The accident occurred early Wednesday along southbound Interstate 81 in Berkeley County, The Journal reported.

Cody Wade Braithwaite, 32, of Winchester, Virginia, was charged with DUI with death, fleeing DUI, and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm and a fugitive from justice, Berkeley County Sheriff Curtis Keller said.

Keller said a deputy investigating calls about a reckless driver attempted to make a traffic stop, but the suspect’s vehicle sped up and hit a car, which then struck a guardrail. The driver of the car was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver’s name was not immediately released.

The suspect’s vehicle also hit a deputy’s cruiser before being stopped, Keller said.

Braithwaite was being held without bond in the Eastern Regional Jail. It wasn’t immediately known whether Braithwaite has an attorney.

Moïse, whose government has been accused of corruption, denounced graft during his speech at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince and urged Haiti’s elite to work with the government and help create employment.

“We’re still extremely poor,” he said. “Those who continue to get rich find it normal that they do not pay taxes, find it normal that there can be no competition, find it normal that they set prices for consumers, especially when this consumer is the state itself.”

Moïse also apologized for the country’s ongoing power outages and renewed his 2016 campaign pledge to provide electricity 24 hours a day, saying it was harder to accomplish than he imagined.

The speech that marked the 216th anniversary of the world’s first black republic was originally slated to take place in the northern coastal town of Gonaives, where Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence. But the town, like many others, was hit by violent protests that began in September amid anger over corruption, fuel shortages and dwindling food supplies as opposition leaders and supporters demanded the resignation of Moïse. More than 40 people have been killed and dozens injured.

Large-scale protests in Port-au-Prince have since dissipated, although smaller ones are still occurring elsewhere in the country. On Wednesday, opposition leaders and supporters gathered in Gonaives to attend the funeral of an anti-government protester and then carried his coffin through the streets as more protesters joined them.

(NEWS ROOM GUYANA) — Three persons are currently hospitalized in a serious condition following an accident on the Crabwood Creek Public Road on New Year’s morning.

According to information received, motorcar PNN 7976 driven by 22-year-old Seeram Ramdat was speeding when it collided with a utility pole, injuring the driver and two passengers.

The News Room understands that while driving over the Blackwater Creek Bridge, Ramdat lost control of the vehicle which turned turtle and careened about 200 feet away before crashing into the utility pole and coming to a halt on a resident’s bridge.

The two occupants, 32-year-old Keron Phillips and 45-year-old Ramnand Kishwar were removed from the wreck in semi-conscious states and rushed to the Skeldon hospital.

The driver fled the scene and was subsequently apprehended at his Lot 80 Grant 1718 Crabwood Creek home in a traumatic state. He was also taken to the Skeldon Hospital where he is admitted in a stable condition.

The News Room understands that the vehicle is owned by an elderly woman, and Ramdatt took it without her knowledge.

Police Commissioner Leslie James on Wednesday disclosed that there has been an 8% increase in road fatalities in 2018.

Police said the fire may have been caused by sky lanterns launched to celebrate the new year.

Several witnesses reported that they had seen the cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight Wednesday near the Krefeld zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city’s head of criminal police told reporters.

“People reported seeing those sky lanterns flying at low altitude near the zoo and then it started burning,” Hoppmann said.

Police and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38 a.m.

The zoo near the Dutch border said that the entire ape house burned down and more than 30 animals, including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys, as well as fruit bats and birds, were killed.

Only two chimpanzees could be rescued from the flames by firefighters. They suffered burns but are in stable condition, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.

“It’s close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,” Dressen said, adding that many animal handlers were in shock at the devastation.

“We have to seriously work through the mourning process,” Dressen said. “This is an unfathomable tragedy.”

The zoo director also said than many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild.

The zoo said that in addition to the two rescued chimpanzees, the Gorilla Garden near to the Ape House didn’t go up in flames and that gorilla Kidogo and six other members of his family group are alive.

Criminal police officer Hoppmann said that the use of sky lanterns is illegal in Krefeld and most other parts of Germany and asked that the people who launched them or people who witnessed anything should come forward to police.

Germans usually welcome in the new year with fireworks at midnight and private persons are allowed to buy and launch fireworks. Sky lanterns, however, are both illegal and uncommon in Germany.

Sky lanterns, which are sometimes also called Chinese lanterns, are a sort of hot-air balloon made of paper. They have been used in Asia for celebratory events for centuries.

Hoppmann said investigators found some used lanterns on the ground that hadn’t burned entirely. They were 34 centimetres (13.4 inches) long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would have been suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.

Hoppmann said some of the lanterns had handwritten notes on them.

“We’re going to have a great year, I predict,” Trump said. “I think it’s going to be a fantastic year.”

The president noted the record year for the American economy, predicting even better economic news.

“I think we’re really set for additional growth and jobs and everything else,” he said. “It’ll be great.”

The president answered questions about the ongoing conflict in Iraq after the American embassy in Baghdad was beset by protesters and American Marines responded.

“They were there instantaneously, as soon as we heard,” he said. “I used the word ‘immediately’; they came immediately. And it’s in great shape, as you know.”

He compared the recent attacks to the devastating attacks in Benghazi in 2012, noting that he would never stand for similar results.

“This will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened,” he said. “This will never, ever be a Benghazi.”

The president warned Iran from continuing to back militia attacks in Iraq but dismissed the idea that the United States was going to war with Iran.

“I want to have peace. I like peace,” he said. “And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don’t see that happening.”

The president also spoke about the impeachment effort led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“I think the impeachment thing — I call it impeachment light,” he said. “It’s a disgrace. And Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself. She’s a highly overrated person. I know her well; she’s highly overrated.”

Trump said he looked forward to an impeachment trial in the Senate.

“As far as I’m concerned, I’d be very happy with the trial because we did nothing wrong,” he said.

The president even wished the press a Happy New Year.

“I want you to have a great year. Look, you’re honorable people. You have to stay honorable,” he said. “If you’re honorable, I’m going to win the election by a lot. If you’re not honorable, I’m just going to win the election by a little. So I’d rather have you be honorable, okay?”

When First Lady Melania Trump was asked about her hopes for the New Year, she replied, “Peace on the world.”

President Trump agreed but said he would not reveal his New Year’s resolution.

“I’m not sure you’re supposed to say resolutions out loud, okay?” he said. “So we don’t want to. I don’t want to say what my resolution is because I think we jinx it, all right?”

“I like peace,” the president said before heading in to New Year’s celebrations.

The president spoke after Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that around 750 troops from a rapid response unit of the 82nd Airborne Division are prepared to deploy over the next several days to the Middle East.

The US had already flown a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy after the attack Tuesday, which left smoke and flames rising from the compound’s entrance and further heightened tension between Tehran and Washington.

US officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no US personnel were reported injured.

The US reinforcements “got in there very quickly,” Trump said.

“I think it’s been handled very well.”

He added that “this will not be a Benghazi,” a reference to an attack in 2012 by radical Islamists on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The all-stock deal is likely to push Zomato to the top position in India's food delivery market, ahead of Swiggy, which counts China's Tencent Holdings as an investor. Zomato - valued at around $3 billion (roughly Rs. 21,300 crores) after raising money from Alibaba affiliate Ant this month - said Uber Eats in India will discontinue operations, and direct restaurants, delivery partners and users to the Zomato platform from Tuesday.

Uber Eats, which also pulled out of South Korea earlier this year, said it will continue to operate in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

While this is the first large acquisition in the Indian online food delivery market, deal activity has been heating up globally.

Earlier this month Dutch firm Takeaway.com pipped investment company Prosus to buy Britain's Just Eat for 6.2 billion pounds ($8.1 billion). In December, Germany's Delivery Hero agreed to buy South Korea's top food delivery app owner Woowa Brothers for $4 billion.

The report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) revealed that variety in cuisines (35 percent) was one of the top reasons for recurrent use of online food ordering apps, followed by good discounts and convenience.

""Food tech has now made its presence in greater than 500 cities in India and with consumer confidence growing, there are new opportunities for the players to 'win with the consumer' in an evolving market,'"" said Roma Datta Chobey, Director-Travel, BFSI, Classifieds, Gaming, Telco & Payments, Google.

Peer or network advocacy (52 percent) played a critical role in drawing people to try online food ordering for the first time.

This was followed by advertisements (19 percent) that emerged to be a strong driver in metros and among the higher income groups across the country.

""Overall online spending in India is rising rapidly and expected to grow at 25 percent over the next five years to reach over $130 billion,"" said Rachit Mathur, Managing Director and Partner, India Lead of BCG's Consumer & Retail Practice.

""Riding on the wave of rapid digitisation and steadily growing consumption, the reach of Food Tech companies has grown six times over the last couple of years and will continue to increase further,"" Mathur added.

Zomato and Swiggy currently dominate the online food delivery market in India. Zomato last week announced it has acquired rival Uber Eats food delivery business in India in an all-stock deal of nearly $350 million and Uber will have 9.99 percent stake in the Deepinder Goyal-led food delivery platform.

The Google-BCG report also suggested that consumers have common impediments that hinder adoption.

A fifth of the respondents stated a lack of trust in the app as the main barrier to usage.

Delivery charges (18 percent), food quality concerns (13 percent) and lack of customisation (10 percent) are other reasons why customers have, so far, not experimented with online food ordering.

""Interestingly, these observations vary based on the maturity of the market. While delivery charges is the top reason for not ordering food online in metro cities; in Tier I cities, lack of trust in apps (29 percent) is the primary roadblock,"" the findings showed.

""Food tech startups have revolutionised the way Indians eat. Ordering food online is now a habit. There is large headroom to increase reach, engagement and usage frequency for food tech apps,"" said Abheek Singhi, Senior Partner and Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group.

The Chandrayaan-3 mission will have a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K. Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.

The Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a ""hard"" landing.

That mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.

ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.

Chandrayaan-3 will have a ""similar configuration"" as the previous mission, Sivan said.

Only the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing's Chang'e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.

India's third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.

Sivan also said ISRO was making ""good progress"" for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.

India has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster ""Gravity"".

Sivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.

He argued that the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States has become such an epidemic that more action is needed beyond statements and pledges from state and local politicians and police officers. “They’re all good people, but they’re not 24/7 on this job,” Hier said. “They have other jobs. Even police, they have traffic issues. … There are so many issues besides the issue of anti-Semitism [that they have to deal with].”

Hier added that it’s important to ensure that politics doesn’t interfere with addressing anti-Semitism. “When you have a Democratic mayor and a Republican governor or vice versa, it’s a different attitude,” Hier said. “It’s just not the right way to handle an epidemic.”

“We need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism.” — Marvin Hier

He also argued that people shouldn’t expect anti-Semitism to dissipate with the election of a new president or a new Congress. “When the whole world is affected by the epidemic called anti-Semitism — and this has happened in Europe for the last 15 years — you cannot legitimately argue that the cause of it in the United States is due to one man,” Hier said without naming President Donald Trump.

An FBI task force that is exclusively focused on handling anti-Semitism is therefore necessary to address the rising anti-Semitism throughout the country, he argued. “We need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism,” Hier said. “That’s the only way that the anti-Semites will wake up because basically they’re going to be targeted, they’re going to be analyzed.”

Hier gave a hypothetical of how the task force would handle an anti-Semitic incident. “Let’s say there’s an attack here in Los Angeles,” he said. “First thing that happens is that everything about the attack is sent immediately to the FBI task force on anti-Semitism. And they become the lead agency. They take over immediately.”

Hier said that the Wiesenthal Center has been in contact with the White House about its proposal for a task force.

“President Trump is aware of it,” Hier said. “He’s been informed of it. … We’ll see what happens. We are pushing very hard. We need bipartisan support.”

Hier urged for a societal unification against anti-Semitism, as he argued that anti-Semitism is emboldened when societies ignore it.

“Society didn’t do the right thing,” he said. “We didn’t recognize that these bigots can return early, and as society, we have to have a program against it, and the program has to unify Democrats and Republicans [and] whatever their political persuasion in Europe. We have to come together to fight this.”","Jewish Groups React to Monsey StabbingsJewish groups have expressed shock and horror over the stabbings that occurred at a rabbi’s house in the New York City suburb of Monsey, N.Y., on the evening of Dec. 28.

The attack occurred at Chabad of Suffern Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg’s home as he was lighting the candles on a menorah to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah. The attacker stabbed five people, including Rottenberg’s son. As of Dec. 30, two of the victims were listed in critical condition and the other three had been released from the hospital.

Grafton Thomas, 37, was arrested on Dec. 29 in connection with the attack. He faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary.

Anti-Defamation League New York and New Jersey Regional Director Evan Bernstein told the Journal he was amazed that Rottenberg and the congregants were still praying and singing following the stabbings.

“They were not going to let this horrific incident impact their ability to celebrate that holiday, and I think it shows the resilience of the Jewish community in these moments that are so difficult,” Bernstein said.

American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris condemned the stabbings in a Dec. 29 statement. “We are witnessing a full-fledged epidemic of anti-Semitic attacks in the New York region. In the last week alone, there has been at least one each day,” Harris said. “What we need is a sustained, get-tough, zero-tolerance policy by local and state officials. And that policy must take equally seriously each incident, whatever its source might be. Anti-Semitism is anti-Semitism.”

He also said, “The promising light of this holiday season must defeat the utter darkness of those who commit such violence in the name of hatred.”

Simon Wiesenthal Center Founder and Dean Rabbi Marvin Hier and Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda Rabbi Abraham Cooper called on President Donald Trump to direct the FBI to create a national task force to protect Jews from anti-Semitic attacks.

“Enough is enough. Jews should not have to fear for their lives in America to go to their houses of worship,” Hier and Cooper said. “The FBI must step up and take the lead in all recent violent hate crimes targeting religious Jews.”

StandWithUs issued a statement, saying the attack “is yet another urgent reminder of the need to confront anti-Semitism at all levels and in all corners of society. Unfortunately, this rise in anti-Semitism also makes clear that Jews in the U.S. and beyond must invest in serious security, learn self-defense, and work with local allies and law enforcement to ensure their safety.”

Orthodox Union Executive Vice President Allen Fagin called for anti-Semitic acts to be treated as domestic terrorism and praised New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for proposing a law to classify anti-Semitic acts as domestic terrorism.

“This was the ninth anti-Semitic attack in the New York City area in the past week,” Fagin said. “It is the fundamental responsibility of government to protect the safety of all of its citizens. This responsibility must be effectuated with all resources necessary to accomplish this purpose.”

Other anti-Semitic incidents that occurred in New York during Hanukkah included a man punching and kicking a Jewish man while shouting, “F— you, Jew” on Dec. 23, a woman hitting a Jewish woman with a bag on Dec. 26 and a man on Dec. 27 threatening to shoot people at Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn.

Bernstein told the Journal he has never seen so many anti-Semitic incidents occur in such a short period during his six-year tenure as regional director of ADL New York and New Jersey.

ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted, “After the hateful assaults we saw this past week in Brooklyn and Manhattan, it is heart-wrenching to see the holiday of Hanukkah violated yet again. We are outraged because the answer is clear: the Jewish community NEEDS greater protection.”","“And the population centers tolerated it.“They have other jobs.Even police, they have traffic issues.… We’ll see what happens.We are pushing very hard.","The attack occurred at Chabad of Suffern Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg’s home as he was lighting the candles on a menorah to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah.As of Dec. 30, two of the victims were listed in critical condition and the other three had been released from the hospital.“We are witnessing a full-fledged epidemic of anti-Semitic attacks in the New York region.Jews should not have to fear for their lives in America to go to their houses of worship,” Hier and Cooper said.We are outraged because the answer is clear: the Jewish community NEEDS greater protection.”",<s> Wetter-Trend Es wird immer wärmer und wärmer: Die Temperaturen in Deutschland steigen stetig an.

A local conservative politician Götz Ulrich spotted the beer earlier this week, saying that it was shameful this business has stayed afloat for so long.

The beverage produced under the brand ""German Reich Brew"" is owned by Tommy Frenck, a former neo-Nazi political figure from neighbouring Thuringia. He announced the launch of the beer online earlier this year along with other Nazi-related goods.

The government on Wednesday slashed import duty on refined palmolein from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, while that on crude palm oil (CPO) from 40 per cent to 37.5 per cent with immediate effect, a move that the industry opposed saying it will hurt domestic refiners. A notification in this regard has been issued by the finance ministry.

The duty cut has been made under the ASEAN agreement and the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (IMCECA), the notification added. Opposing the move, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) said that after the reduction in import duty, the tax difference between CPO and refined palmolein has reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. “This will have serious impact on domestic palm oil refining industry and oilseeds farmers. We fear import of refined palmolien would increase and capacity utilisation of our industry would be affected leading to potential loss of employment,” SEA Executive Director B V Mehta said in a statement.

After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP). “Lower import duty would make it difficult to defend MSP and the new found enthusiasm of the oilseed farmers would be dampened,” he said. The country’s edible oil imports are now touching 70 per cent of the consumption. The duty cut would be counterproductive and contrary to the government’s stated objective of increasing domestic oilseed production, he added. Asserting that India too should protect the interest of farmers like Malaysia and Indonesia, the SEA said Indonesia from January 1 has imposed export duty of USD 50 on CPO and USD 30 on refined palmolien.

Similarly, Malaysia has imposed export duty of USD 31 on CPO and zero duty on refined palmolein which work out to be nearly 5 per cent on CPO value, thus effective duty difference is hardly 2.5 per cent only. “We strongly appeal to the government to increase the duty differential between CPO and refined palm oil to 15 per cent, by taking appropriate measures,” the industry body added.","Delhi weather update: Delhiites shiver at 2.4 deg CelsiusThe air quality recorded at 9.38 am was 433 in the “severe” category.

From Boeing to Whole Foods, companies are touting social responsibility as profits soar. Don't believe a word of it

Corporate social responsibility is the second-biggest con of 2019 (Donald Trump remains in first place).

Consider Boeing, whose board just fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, in order ""to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders.""

Restore confidence? Muilenburg's successor will be David Calhoun, who, as a longstanding member of Boeing's board of directors, allowed Muilenburg to remain CEO for more than a year after the first 737 Max crash and after internal studies found that the jetliner posed an unacceptable risk of accident. It caused the deaths of 346 people.

Muilenburg raked in $30m in 2018. He could walk away from Boeing with another $60m.

Boeing isn't the only large corporation with a confidence problem. Until his ouster, Muilenburg was a director of the Business Roundtable, an association of 192 CEOs of America's largest corporations. With great fanfare last August, it announced a ""fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders"" (emphasis in the original) and not just their shareholders.

The Roundtable's commitment came in response to growing public distrust of big corporations, and proposals from several Democratic candidates to rein them in.

Another Business Roundtable director is Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors. Just weeks after making the commitment, and despite GM's hefty profits and large tax breaks, Barra rejected workers' demands that GM raise their wages and stop outsourcing their jobs. Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

About 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn't save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM's stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22m last year.

Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is another member of the Business Roundtable. Just weeks after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce.

The annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos -- whose net worth is $110bn -- makes in two hours. (Bezos's nearly completed DC mansion will have two elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.)

GE's CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15m last year.","The left’s constant victimhood olympics is a gift to anti-SemitesPolice have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

The book is an interesting read, even for someone like me, with knowledge of the Soviet and Russian intelligence services operations abroad. The facts I knew from my work and upbringing in the Soviet system are correctly conveyed, and those I didn't know, are interesting and - in many cases - intriguing.

Whether the reader is in the USA, or the UK, or anywhere, they might realize that the authors cover a huge and wide net, spread around the globe.

Perhaps the most interesting parts are those, which provide information, discovered or put together by the authors - that's where they are the strongest narrators.

Especially of interest for the American readers, in my humble opinion, might be the episodes, describing the financial flows between Russia and the US.

All over the book, and sometimes even between the lines, one could start seeing the origins of the power of today's ruling elite, and the connections it has built with the West.

The governor said he had already done whatever he was supposed to do on the controversial issue.

""Now, it is up to the government (state government) to do the needful,"" Malik told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by the CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography near here.

Referring to his meeting with the prime minister in mid December, 2019, the governor said, ""I had given the PM a note on Mahadayi (and) after that whatever had to happen has happened, that's all. I don't want to say anything more on it"".

When asked whether the BJP-led state government has spoken to him on the issue, Malik replied in the negative.

Goa and Karnataka are locked in a bitter dispute over sharing the water of the Mahadayi river.

A letter written by Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to the Karnataka government in October, 2019, in which he reportedly exempted the neighbouring state from taking the Environment Clearance (EC) for a project on the river, had sparked a row.

In another letter on December 18, Javadekar kept his earlier communication in abeyance. However, on December 24, he again informed the Karnataka government that the EC was not required for the project on the river.

""On the issue of Mahadayi, whatever I had to do, I have done. If the government asks for my help, I would offer it...I don't want to talk about it,"" the governor said, adding that Mahadayi has become a controversial issue.

According to Cork County Council, which runs the tourist attraction, there were 81,000 visitors to Spike in 2019, marking a 15 per cent increase on the previous year’s figures and ahead of projected growth.

The increase in visitor numbers has prompted Cork County Council to increase access to the island with opening being extended to seven days a week from April to October and weekends in February, March and November.

Spike Island manager John Crotty said that the 15 per cent growth in visitor numbers in 2019 was particularly welcome, especially given some tourist attractions in Ireland saw little growth this year.

“The growth in visitors is above the target set for the island and also saw the site outperform the general tourism market – we welcomed 81,000 visitors in 2019 in what has been a year of conflicting fortunes for Irish visitor attractions.

“While Tourism Ireland say overall visitor numbers to the country were up slightly, a slowing market has seen some sites post flat or negative numbers in 2019, with concern for the UK and European markets in the coming years.

“Brexit, changes in European habits and ‘flight shame’ over concerns of the impact the aviation industry is having on the environment were all said to be contributing to the uncertainty.

Mr Crotty revealed that Spike Island overseas visitors accounted for a greater proportion of the total, rising from 17.5 per cent in 2018 to 21 per cent last year. This was welcome as international visitors are known to spend more than domestic visitors.

He pointed out that the growth in visitor numbers in 2019 followed some important additions including adding a second ferry, procured from the south of France, and a new walk-on pontoon which replaced previous steps in Cobh.

He said the new “Independence” exhibition, telling the story of the 1,400 prisoners held on the island in 1921 during the War of Independence, also opened on the island and proved highly successful.

“In 2020, there are plans to add a covered ticket office at Kennedy Pier in Cobh, a calendar of concerts and events along with a new exhibition telling the story of the Famine-era convicts who did not survive the island prison experience.”

Upward trend

Mr Crotty said that with these new exhibitions and events and an extension of the opening season to seven days a week from April to October, they hope to see the upward trend in visitor numbers continue into 2020.

He pointed out that the former island prison and fortress had only reopened in June 2016, following €6.5 million of investment by Cork County Council and Failte Ireland.

That investment saw the reopening of the Famine-era prison, the 9.7-hectare (24 acre) island fortress, the modern prison, which only closed in 2004, and scenic walking trails around the outer island, as well as a cafe and gift shop on site.

“We currently have a funding application with Fáilte Ireland, with plans to add a social village recreation of island life, a ‘dungeon’-style experience in the fort tunnels and an international welcome hub at the island pier.”

In October 2017, Spike Island was named as Europe’s leading tourist attraction at the prestigious World Travel Awards.

Last November, Spike Island scooped another prestigious award, being named Best Attraction at the International Travel and Tourism Awards 2019 held in London.","Taoiseach makes first general election campaign pitch in New Year videoTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has made a first general election campaign pitch by promising to help deliver 50,000 new jobs and provide 25,000 new homes in the State this year.

In a New Year video, Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney list Fine Gael priorities for the coming year.

Mr Varadkar says he will steer Ireland through the next phase of Brexit by helping to secure a trade deal between the European Union and the UK; he also vows to give Irish businesses and farmers access to the British market; and promises to “achieve a new record high when it comes to employment”.

“We know that well-paid secure jobs are the best ways to improve living standards, create opportunity, and reduce poverty,” he says.

The Taoiseach also claims the Government will add 11,000 units to the social housing stock. “That’s more new social houses than any other year this century under any other party,” he says.

The Taoiseach’s messages also alludes to climate change, with promises to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating warmer homes, improving air quality and investing in public transport.

The video is the second such broadcast made by the Taoiseach in recent days. On St Stephen’s Day, he described his achievements since assuming office 2½ years ago.

It is one of a number of social media broadcasts and publications recently issued by Fine Gael, suggesting the party is upping the ante ahead of a general election, which is widely expected to take place in the spring.

Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton has also announced a raft of initiatives on waste, packaging and climate change in recent days.

Climate change and the “green agenda” are expected to be major themes of the election campaign. Fine Gael, in particular, may be vulnerable to rising support for the Green Party in affluent urban areas, after that party’s strong performance in the local and European elections and November’s byelections.","Spike Island visitor numbers treble in three yearsAn exhibition outlining the role of Spike Island as a prison during the War of Independence has helped visitor numbers to the island attraction in Cork Harbour treble in the last three years.“While Tourism Ireland say overall visitor numbers to the country were up slightly, a slowing market has seen some sites post flat or negative numbers in 2019, with concern for the UK and European markets in the coming years.“Brexit, changes in European habits and ‘flight shame’ over concerns of the impact the aviation industry is having on the environment were all said to be contributing to the uncertainty.He pointed out that the growth in visitor numbers in 2019 followed some important additions including adding a second ferry, procured from the south of France, and a new walk-on pontoon which replaced previous steps in Cobh.Last November, Spike Island scooped another prestigious award, being named Best Attraction at the International Travel and Tourism Awards 2019 held in London.","In a New Year video, Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney list Fine Gael priorities for the coming year.“We know that well-paid secure jobs are the best ways to improve living standards, create opportunity, and reduce poverty,” he says.Happy New Year!On St Stephen’s Day, he described his achievements since assuming office 2½ years ago.Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton has also announced a raft of initiatives on waste, packaging and climate change in recent days.","reprinted from Daylight Atheism, Syndicated by PeaceVoice)

Long ago, when I was a congressional press secretary, Jennings Randolph was a wise senator from West Virginia. On his Washington desk, he kept a motto I never forgot:

""The most important lesson you can learn is that other people are as real behind their eyes as you are behind yours.""

That nugget of insight has deep implications, asserting that nearly everyone in the world all seven billion-plus of them more or less share the same human feelings, fears, wants, hopes, questions, frustrations, pleasures and the like.

This, to me, is the heart of humanism: recognizing the worth of everyone, and striving to make life as good as possible for the whole populace.

Humanism means helping people, and secular humanism means doing it without supernatural religion.

It began as long ago in ancient Greece, when some thinkers advocated humanitas, a helpful spirit toward all. During the Renaissance, a few scholar-priests began caring more for people than for the church, so they became religious humanists. Then came the Enlightenment, when rebel thinkers challenged the supremacy of kings and holy men. They laid the groundwork for modern democracy, which is rooted in humanism.

Various manifestos have been written to crystallize the need for intelligent people to support human betterment. In 1933, the first Humanist Manifesto was signed by three dozen philosophers, Unitarians, reformers and scholars, including John Dewey. It called humanism a new ""religion"" to replace magic-based supernatural faiths.

Accra, Jan. 1, GNA - Venadash Institute of Decorative Arts, a private vocational training institution in the Ho Municipality, has graduated 22 women who have completed courses in event decoration, beadwork, cake baking and decoration, and catering.



At its seventh graduation ceremony held at the Global Evangelical Church at Ho Fiave, Mrs Venunye Afi Adugu, Director of the Institute, said the institute, established in 2011, has so far trained 24 batches of students, most of whom had excelled in the National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) proficiency examinations.

The theme: for the graduation was “Job Creation for the Youth through Skills Acquisition.”

Mrs Adugu said the achievements were because of the efficient and practical teaching by the tutors adding that the graduates were already executing excellent works for their clients.

The Director said the institute had plans to add hat making and fashion design to its line of programmes, beginning next academic year.

Mrs Adugu asked students to take the courses seriously and provide the needed tools and materials for competency-based training.

She said Venadash was on a mission of entrepreneurship development to help address youth unemployment, and advised against truancy, asking parents and guardians not to consider vocational skills training as reserved for school dropouts.

“Vocational and technical skills acquisition requires high intelligent quotient and critical analytical minds to be able to innovate and create. We, therefore, appeal to parents and guardians to desist from discouraging their wards who want to venture into these fields of study. You will never know what the future holds,” she said.

Mr Kenneth Kponor, the Volta Regional Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), asked the graduates to make the most of the training and strive to become entrepreneurs and open up employment avenues for others.

He also urged them to encourage their peers to consider vocational skills as a lifeline they could easily access.

The institute was established as the Venadash Training Center, providing skills training in bead making and event decoration.

It was in 2012, transformed into an institute, and adopted the syllabus of the University of Florida, USA, and won accreditation from the National Vocational Training Board in 2015.

It operates faculties of Applied Arts, and Culinary Arts, and runs two programme sessions each academic year.

Posted

Government benefits ensure new parents are offered paid maternity and paternity leave, and a UK company is now offering its Australian employees a similar scheme when they bring home a new pet.

Key points: A Brisbane brewery is offering ""pawternity leave"" for staff who are new pet owners

The week-long paid pet leave is meant to be an incentive for employees to stay longer

RSCPA Queensland says getting a pet is like bringing a new baby home and it is important to have time to bond

The ""pawternity leave"" scheme is available to staff at BrewDog's Brisbane brewery, which opened late November, company spokesman Calvin McDonald said.

""Pawternity leave is a great benefit that BrewDog can offer its employees worldwide,"" he said.

""Basically it's an extra paid week of leave that you're able to take when you adopt a puppy or get a new puppy in the house.""

Mr McDonald said the perk had been crucial to retaining staff in an industry like hospitality — notorious for its high turnover.

""It means that they don't really want to leave and go anywhere else,"" Mr McDonald said.

While it is an unusual incentive, paid new-pet leave is not completely unheard of in the Australian or international employment market.

The concept has been praised by the RSPCA Queensland, which recommended monitoring pets brought home from their facilities very closely.

RSPCA spokeswoman Nanda Ten Grotenhuis said the first few days could be crucial.

""It's a bit like bringing a new baby home so, you know, you need a little bit of special time for you to bond with that animal to make them feel comfortable,"" Ms Ten Grotenhuis said.

Staff at RSPCA Queensland are not offered ""pawternity leave"", but staff can take sick or carer's leave when their own pet is unwell.

Brisbane mum Kasey Rowland took two weeks annual leave this time last year, when she introduced her new Cavoodle, Raphael, to her young family.

The part-time worker was not entitled to paid pet leave but said she was honest with her employer, who allowed her to take the break and ensure her pet assimilated safely.

""I think it's part of being a responsible dog owner, that you make sure that they're safe and happy and stimulated,"" Ms Rowland said.

""I was a bit worried because for a small dog it's a huge place and he could get into things and get his head stuck in the fence.""

BrewDog has offered the incentive for several years now to its staff internationally.

Sydney-based Pet Circle is another company ensuring its staff are compensated when looking after a new pet.

Lisa Bradley, from the Queensland University of Technology's business school, said it was increasingly common for employers to negotiate flexible working conditions to attract hard-working staff.

""Different types of leave provisions are the most common and being able to work from different locations and at different times,"" she said.

Ms Bradley said it was hard to weigh up the cost benefits for employers who were ultimately pursuing ""increased organisational commitment"".

""That means the person is going to want to continue to work for the organisation and put in their best for the organisation, so sometimes you can't measure the benefits of that directly,"" Ms Bradley said.

The 28-year-old was laid low early in the season and was far from his best after he returned to action, although he did reach the US Open and Paris Masters semi-finals.

Dimitrov said 2019, where he failed to win a title, had been ""quite a journey"".

""It's going to be a year that I remember for the rest of my life,"" he said in Sydney ahead of the inaugural ATP Cup team event, his warm-up for the Australian Open Grand Slam.

""Yeah, the body checks out pretty good right now. I'm still monitoring a lot of my work, a lot that I'm going through.

""I kind of pace myself in the right way. I'm not in a rush, which is also a good thing."" The shoulder problem was Dimitrov's first major injury and he said he plans to limit the number of tournaments he plays, particularly early in the season.

""I'm not going to force myself to play too many tournaments early on and really look after the body. That's the number one thing,"" said Dimitrov, now ranked 20.

""Clearly I haven't competed for almost the past four months of the year, and so that itself brought a lot of doubts, and dropping a lot in the ranking and so on.

""But at the same time, I was able to kind of recover as quick as possible, and hopefully now I'm at a place that can only get better. I'm really going to focus on that.""



He is not only playing for Bulgaria at the ATP Cup, but captaining the team, a new experience that he is relishing.

""It's challenging, no doubt about it,"" he said.

""It's always been a dream of mine to always be kind of on the other end, and I think to be a coach is never easy.

Wekundu wa Msimbazi extend their stay at the top of the top-tier table after a convincing home win

Simba SC opened a 10-point gap on top of the Mainland Table after defeating Ndanda FC 2-0.

The defending champions came into the match as clear favourites having won 10 out of 11 games against their opponents in previous meetings. Being the final game of 2019, Wekundu wa Msimbazi were keen on avoiding surprises and bag maximum points.

Former winger Francis Kahata took only 13 minutes to open the scoring for the 20-time league champions. The hosts won a free-kick about 20-yards from the Ndanda goal; then the Kenyan international curled the ball past the wall and into the back of the net to score his second goal in as many games for his club.

Neither of the two teams could get another goal in the first half despite the numerous chances created especially by the league leaders. Ibrahim Ajib and the returning John Bocco were responsible for missing glorious opportunities for their teams.

Substitute Deo Kanda, who had come on for Francis Kahata, handed the hosts the final blow in the 86th minute when he deflected in a Gadiel Michael shot past goalkeeper Ally Mustapha.

The result took Simba's points tally to 34, 10 more than second-placed Yanga SC. The two teams will play each other on Saturday in the Kariakoo Derby.

Elsewhere, Mwadui FC settled to a 1-1 draw against KMC at Mwadui Complex; the visitors opened the scoring in the 15th minute courtesy of Abdul Hilal before Enock Mkanga equalized in the 70th minute.","MIAABig game right off the bat as we resume league play in 2020. 12-0 Hope at 8-3 Trine on Saturday at 3pm. Hope currently stands as the #1 team in the nation according to Massey and Trine comes in as #23. Hope had a real test against Albion, other than that they have run roughshod thru the 2019 portion of their schedule. Trine with losses to Ohio Wesleyan, #12 Baldwin Wallace and #23 Chicago. They have 2 recent wins over good Ohio Northern and Denison squads and are starting to figure things out with new lineups and substitute patterns.



Both Hope and Trine play a deep bench as both only have 1 double digit scorer. Hope with an outstanding and deep Junior class, whereas Trine has 3 Soph's leading in scoring. The big question at the beginning of the year was how far would Trine regress this year after an outstanding Senior class graduated that led Trine to 3 consecutive NCAA tournaments. This team does not have a ""go to"" player like Dawson who could single handily take over games if needed over her career. We have one Senior, two Juniors, and the rest Soph's and Freshman in the top 11 rotation.



You know Hope is going to pressure the ball and get scores off their defense. You don't see many D3 teams with their length inside either. Our bigs Taylor and Herbert will need to play well and stay out of foul trouble. If were shooting the 3ball decently we'll have a shot to be there at the end, but I am going with Hope by 10+ in this one as they have more experience and playmakers than Trine.","Kahata on target as Simba SC open a 10-point gap with win against NdandaKahata on target as Simba SC open a 10-point gap with win against Ndanda

Moïse, whose government has been accused of corruption, denounced graft during his speech at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince and urged Haiti’s elite to work with the government and help create employment.

“We’re still extremely poor,” he said. “Those who continue to get rich find it normal that they do not pay taxes, find it normal that there can be no competition, find it normal that they set prices for consumers, especially when this consumer is the state itself.”

Moïse also apologized for the country’s ongoing power outages and renewed his 2016 campaign pledge to provide electricity 24 hours a day, saying it was harder to accomplish than he imagined.

The speech that marked the 216th anniversary of the world’s first black republic was originally slated to take place in the northern coastal town of Gonaives, where Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence. But the town, like many others, was hit by violent protests that began in September amid anger over corruption, fuel shortages and dwindling food supplies as opposition leaders and supporters demanded the resignation of Moïse. More than 40 people have been killed and dozens injured.

Large-scale protests in Port-au-Prince have since dissipated, although smaller ones are still occurring elsewhere in the country. On Wednesday, opposition leaders and supporters gathered in Gonaives to attend the funeral of an anti-government protester and then carried his coffin through the streets as more protesters joined them.

The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday observed its 22nd Foundation Day as ‘Citizens’ Day’ as a mark of protest against the amended Citizenship Act and pledged not to stop until the “draconian law” is withdrawn. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, also the TMC supremo, congratulated party workers on the occasion and said TMC is observing the day as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ (Citizens’ Day) at the booth-level. “We are observing the foundation day of @AITCofficial as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ (Citizens’ Day) in every booth of #Bangla. We all are citizens and Trinamool will continue to fight for the rights of the people. Jai Hind. Jai Bangla. “#Trinamool22 Today @AITCofficial turns 22.

The journey which began on January 1, 1998 has been full of struggles, but we have been steadfast in our resolve to fight for the people. We thank Maa-Mati-Manush for their constant support. Our workers are our biggest assets,” she tweeted. TMC general secretary Subrata Bakshi said laws are passed to help the people and not to divide the country. “The amended Citizenship Act is anti-people. It wants to divide the country on religious lines. So, if the people don’t accept it, this law has to be withdrawn,” he said.

Claiming that the people of West Bengal have started rejecting the BJP, Bakshi hinted that the party would use the CAA and the proposed country-wide NRC as its main issues in the upcoming municipal elections in the state. Elections to around 107 municipalities of the state including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are due in April-May this year. The civic polls, in which about 60 per cent voters of the state would be eligible to take part, are being tipped as the ‘mini assembly election’ ahead of the crucial 2021 state polls.

Parties believe that the results of the civic polls will indicate the possible outcome of the assembly elections. Banerjee had last week instructed party workers to conduct various programmes to observe the TMC’s foundation day. The district TMC leaders have organised flag-hoisting programmes and street corner meetings to discuss and highlight the achievements of the state government and speak against the amended Citizenship Act, party sources said. Banerjee, who has been at the forefront in opposing the CAA and nation-wide NRC, has been crisscrossing the state, holding protest marches and rallies against the new citizenship law. On the party’s foundation day, TMC activists also organised blood donation camps in several parts of the state.

The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998 with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power. The party achieved its goal in May 2011 after forging an alliance with the Congress.","Actor Swara Bhasker lauds Jamia students for waking up entire country against CAATerming the CAA a “targeted” law, she said it is an attack on the Constitution of India.

Weighing in at 4.367 kg, Henri was born to parents Amélie Bouchard and Marc-André Baillargeon.

The couple had a feeling their son would be the first born in 2020, ever since the hospital's medical team told them their cesarean section would be scheduled for 11:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve.

""I kept looking at the clocks in the hospital,"" Marc-André Baillargeon said in a phone interview.

Henri was initially due on Dec. 20, but Bouchard's pregnancy ""dragged on"" for 12 days, her husband said.

Bouchard said the hat Henri has been wearing is inscribed with the year ""2020"" and was actually made by hospital volunteers as a gift for the first baby of the year.

Birth at the MUHC

Eleven minutes after Henri's birth, Lucas Beelen was born at the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), weighing in at 3.80 kg. The baby's mother, Marilou Edger and father Jonathan Beelen are both from Montreal.

In a Facebook post Wednesday, the MUHC said Lucas and his mother are both doing well.

Mathew Barzal is the only representative for the New York Islanders at this year's NHL All-Star Game. If anyone else could join him who would you send?

Like most years, the New York Islanders will have a single representative going to the NHL All-Star game. This year, Mathew Barzal is the Islanders lone ambassador. I know, what a surprise! (Note the heavy sarcasm.)

Of course, Barzal going to be the Islanders representative at the NHL All-Star Game. He leads the team in goals, assists, and points. He's the star of the team and the face of the franchise. He's also dynamic at the 3on3 format of the All-Star game.

Last year, in his first trip to the All-Star festivities, Barzal was the talk of the town. Lining up with Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, Barzal put up five points in the championship game alone.

After winning last year's 3on3 tournament, Crosby raved about the Islanders youngster and his skill at 3on3 (and 5on5):

""The way he holds onto the puck, the way he skates, 3-on-3, I mean, I don't know if there is anyone better when it comes to holding onto it,"" Crosby said. ""The way he can just beat you 1-on-1, beat you with his speed, hold onto it, you know, watching him out there against the best, and I don't see anyone that really beats him in that category.

Again, it makes sense that Barzal is going. He deserves to go.

But what about other players on the roster? Who else might have deserved to go to the All-Star Game?

I'm stopping short of calling this a snub list because I understand why some of the names I've come up with didn't end up on the final roster. But when I look at the goalies who were selected to the Metro's All-Star team, and that neither one of them are from the New York Islanders, it's clear there's at least one snub.","Prefabulous: The Best Prefab Homes of 20192019 was a big year for prefab due to increased deregulation of ADUs and growing interest in offsite and modular construction. Cities such as San Jose, California, are using prefab ADUs as possible solutions to their housing shortages. These five prefab houses are top-tier, providing innovative alternatives to more expensive housing. But they’re not just space-saving, practical, and easy to build—they’re stylish as all get-out, from clean, Scandinavian designs to aerospace-inspired prefab cabins.

Whether it’s Kanye’s dome prototypes or Ikea’s plan to design residences for people with dementia, prefab housing of all stripes continued to make headlines in 2019. For our year-end roundup of the best prefabs, however, we’re highlighting the most impressive designs that are available to order.

You’ll notice that a few of these picks are intended as accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which have had quite a year, especially in California, where new laws are making it easier for single-family homes to add a backyard unit. As prefab construction is particularly well-suited for the job, we’ll surely be looking out for more sophisticated, ADU-friendly prefabs heading into 2020 and beyond.

A city-approved modern ADU

In an effort to incentivize more housing stock, the city of San Jose, California, recently pre-approved a backyard dwelling from Bay Area housing startup Abodu so that residents can buy and install one in as little as two weeks. The 500-square-foot house, designed by U.K. studio Koto, costs $199,000 and offers Scandinavian modern style with stark white walls, pale wood floors, and the option to add a curated furniture package.

"" Women are sources of life . Yet they are continually insulted, beaten, raped, forced to prostitute themselves and to suppress the life they bear in the womb,"" the Pontiff told worshipers gathered at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on Wednesday.

""Every form of violence inflicted upon a woman is a blasphemy against God, who was born of a woman.""

Shortly before beginning his traditional New Year's Day address , the Pope said he was sorry for smacking a woman's hand the previous day, to free himself from her grip.

""I apologize for the poor example yesterday,"" he said, going off-script before the sermon on violence.

Pope Francis had been making his way to the Nativity scene in Vatican City on Tuesday, New Year's Eve. When he began to walk away from the crowd that had gathered to greet him, video shows a woman grabbing his hand and yanking him toward her.

He became visibly upset, slapping the woman's hand in an attempt to extricate himself. Footage of the altercation also appears to show him shouting at the woman.

Prior to the incident, the woman had made the sign of the cross. She addressed the 83-year-old Pope as she took his hand but it is unclear what she was trying to tell him.

During his New Year address on Wednesday, the Pontiff also spoke about gender equality, telling the congregation that women ""should be fully included in decision-making processes.""

""Every step forward for women, is a step forward for humanity as a whole.""","Pope says sorry for slapping devoteePope Francis apologised for ""losing patience"" with a woman who grabbed him on New Year's Eve and later denounced ""all violence against women"" (AFP Photo/Andreas SOLARO)

Vatican City (AFP) - Pope Francis apologised Wednesday for his widely-viewed slap of a woman who had grabbed his hand as he greeted Catholic faithful on New Year's Eve.

The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media.

A personal apology followed.

""We lose patience many times,"" Francis confessed.

""It happens to me too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,"" the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.

Twitter enthusiasts commented with abandon on the pontiff's prompt riposte to the woman.

Francis had greeted children before the Nativity scene on Saint Peter's square and was turning away when the woman who had crossed herself then cried out something, pulled on his hand and almost caused him to fall.

The 83-year-old pope grimaced before managing to break free by slapping her hand twice.

He continued his tour, walking with some difficulty while maintaining a slightly greater distance from visitors, and gradually relaxed again as he came into contact with other children.

Twitter comments were mostly supportive of the pontiff's instinctive reaction.

""HE IS HUMAN.. Been (sic) a Pope doesn't make you immune to Pain or avoid Reaction to pain,"" one typical comment read.

In his first Mass of the New Year, the pontiff later denounced ""all violence against women"" as ""a profanation of God, born of a woman.""

Francis also said women were ""the source of life"" but deplored that they were constantly ""offended, beaten, abused and forced into prostitution"" and forced to ""supress the life they carry within"" them.

He emphasised that the ""rebirth of humanity began with a woman,"" and bemoaned that women's bodies were ""sacrificed on the profane altars of advertising, profit, pornography.""","Yet they are continually insulted, beaten, raped, forced to prostitute themselves and to suppress the life they bear in the womb,"" the Pontiff told worshipers gathered at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on Wednesday.""Every form of violence inflicted upon a woman is a blasphemy against God, who was born of a woman.""Footage of the altercation also appears to show him shouting at the woman.Prior to the incident, the woman had made the sign of the cross.She addressed the 83-year-old Pope as she took his hand but it is unclear what she was trying to tell him.","Pope says sorry for slapping devoteePope Francis apologised for ""losing patience"" with a woman who grabbed him on New Year's Eve and later denounced ""all violence against women"" (AFP Photo/Andreas SOLARO)

The trouble is that we have whole audiences caught between stools right now. They're confused about which side to sit on. They're uncertain about what position to take, so they step back and let someone else do their thinking for them. Members of Congress who swallow their consciences to please the system rather than the Gospel are not going to stand for anything. Surely the wealthy who vote for their stock returns and their tax reductions rather than for the upbuilding of the needs of the entire nation are not going to worry about little things ― like somebody else's poverty. And without doubt, average persons who can't tell the political lies from the truth anymore may know what's right in their hearts but have no idea what happened to the congressional process that once decided those things together. So inured are we to alternative facts, competing values, unclear constitutional interpretations, and the difference between national laws and, well, the rise of an imperial presidency, it's impossible to know who knows what. When a ""royal presidency"" ― an oxymoron in itself, like bittersweet or open secrets or living deaths ― suddenly outranks any other law-making force in the country, the people who've been lied to quit believing in facts all together. Now ""facts"" are just one more movable feast. ""They all lie,"" people say of politicians and national agencies and the media and even of the scientists they've been taught to doubt so that corporations don't have to make any ecological changes to their products or processes. Indeed, the people have been taught to doubt, so now government and science are begging us to save ourselves because it is already too late to debate climate change. But how can we save anything while we keep rolling back ecological regulations for the sake of short-term corporate profiteering? How is a nation supposed to trust anyone or any laws at all when the president himself, having declared himself above it, simply deals with the law by refusing to keep it, to honor it, to submit to its review and validation? In the face of that kind of reasoning, tell your teenager that we're a country of laws and hear the laughter in the background. Only this time, it's at you.

In a world such as that, maybe it's just better to keep your head down, many think, and follow the herd rather than risk attention, or worse, risk public disapproval. Do little and say nothing at all has become the new definition of peace and security in a land of political turmoil and working families living in tent cities due to the lack of a decent minimum wage and to the disappearance of low-cost housing. This, while at the same time, they tell us the economy is soaring for some while we're spending money building walls instead of raising the minimum wage to a living wage. I give up: Where's the moderation? In fact, is moderation moral when topics such as those aren't even being discussed and debated in the highest level in government? So much for democracy. We've seen democracies destroyed. But it is just as possible to simply let ours die on the vine from the plague of federal indifference. In a between-the-stools population and political system, being neither hot nor cold has become a fine art. It has its own set of norms, of course: As in, ""Say nothing about what you don't like. Be silent and hope this awful nightmare finally ends. Move over and make room for the white nationalists, the racists, the automatic rifles, the new elected monarchy."" After all, ""there were very fine people on both sides,"" right? The problem? The whole scene has the tone of ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Everybody's lined up, smiling a pasted-down smile, sure that the world can be saved despite the fact that few are saying anything to save it. Like demand gun laws. Like rejoin the Paris climate agreement. Like stop the tariff war. Like impose ecological regulations immediately before the next city is underwater and the poor have no water at all. No, moderation won't do it. What we need now is Christian extremism, the idea that there are some things that cannot be tolerated in life, that there is something we can do to resolve these logjams if we really want to do it. These are the people who are ""either hot or cold."" And Jesus loves them. Christian extremism is extremely concerned about what this era of insult and mockery has sown. We need people who don't change TV news channels because the news ""depresses"" them. Instead they listen carefully to understand what needs to be done and they join mixed groups to start doing it. Locally as well as globally. Christian extremists are extremely open to new ideas. They read good articles carefully. They call for the creation of mixed groups to consider what can be done about issues on a local level. They find out from local officials what can be done to control guns, for instance, and provide medical care, and start subsidized housing, and invest in ecological preservation. They take part in democracy, in other words, as any citizen who wants to keep it must do.","Choices galore for financial advisors, but pick the one suitable for youNowadays, registered investments advisors (RIAs), financial planners, financial advisors, wealth managers, even money doctors are pretty much tossed around and used interchangeably.

AGRA: A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point on Yamuna Expressway early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj Agarwal, his wife Neha (35) and his daughter Dhanya (6), were found dead, his son Shaurya,10, is battling for life at a Delhi hospital.As per documents accessed by TOI, Agarwal was facing multiple inquiries from Income Tax department, commercial tax department and Economic Offences Wing for Rs 123-crore transactions after demonetisation in November 2016. Police say that the Enforcement Directorate was also on his trail and he was under heavy debt. “These could be likely reasons which pushed him to the brink,” they say.His family, however, claimed that Agarwal was killed at the behest of his business rivals. “Some people had shot at Neeraj two years ago in Govardhan area and a police complaint was filed in this regard. Fortunately, he survived as the bullet nicked just his car,” said his father Dinesh Chandra Agarwal. The family is based in Govindnagar area of Mathura but Neeraj, along with his family, was living in Delhi for the past one year.“Neeraj used to come to Mathura frequently. His wife also hailed from Mathura’s Jaganathpuri area,” his father added. He admitted that some inquiries were going on against him. “But Neeraj had filed an appeal in the cases and this this could not be the reason for his death,” he said.Police said that the incident took place early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj’s body was found on the driver’s seat of Tuscon, all other three members of his family were on the back seat and had gunshot injuries on their head. The car was locked from inside. According to SP (city) AK Meena, Neeraj’s son was found breathing when the police broke the glass of the car and he was immediately rushed to Nayati hospital from where he was shifted to Apollo hospital, Delhi, as his condition was critical.Meena told TOI that a small note was also found inside the car and the it had been sent to forensic wing for checking its authenticity. Though the note was not clear, it had a mention of some issues related to custom and penalties. He said, police found a pistol in Neeraj’s right hand and he had apparently shot himself on his right temple.Neeraj’s brother-in-law, Amit, told TOI that his sister, Neha and her family had dinner with them and they all appeared happy. “They had left late on Tuesday night for Delhi as their daughter’s program was scheduled early Wednesday morning,” he told TOI. Amit has filed a complaint in this matter and an FIR is being lodged at police station.In July 2018, the investigation wing of I-T department had conducted a raid at RS Bullion and Jewellers in Mathura, owned by Neeraj Agarwal and Neha Agarwal, and found large-scale anomalies during the period after demonetisation. According to reports, RS Bullion had alone deposited Rs 123 crore cash in bank accounts during demonetisation.After the raid, the I-T officials had told media persons that Neeraj claimed to have sold gold worth Rs 37 crore in a single day, however, records suggested that his firm converted black money of people into white by taking commission. In return, the trader had provided them receipt of gold purchase. Also, the trader, had claimed that he had taken gold stock from a firm in Mumbai — Vanity Jeweller — but it was closed down in 2012, much before demonetisation announced.","Businessman, wife, daughter found dead inside SUV with bullet woundsNeeraj, his wife Neha with their children. Neeraj, his wife Neha with their children.

A businessman, his wife and daughter were found dead in an SUV early Wednesday morning in Mathura. According to police, Neeraj Agarwal (40) allegedly shot his wife Neha Agarwal (36) and two children, a girl aged six and a boy aged 10, before shooting himself. No suicide note has been recovered, said police.

While the couple and their daughter were declared dead on arrival at the hospital, their son has been referred to Delhi’s Apollo Hospital for further treatment and is under observation. Their families, however, have alleged foul play and filed an FIR under IPC Section 302 (murder) at the Jamna Paar police station in Mathura.

Ashok Kumar Meena, SP City Mathura, said: “We received information from a patrol vehicle about four bodies being found in a white SUV, close to the Vrindavan turning near the Yamuna Expressway. They broke open a window and found that the boy was still alive. The others in the car, including a minor, had died due to bullet wounds. Prima facie it appeared that Neeraj shot his family members before killing himself. But we have received an FIR for possible murder, which will be investigated.”

Neeraj hailed from Jagannath Puri in Mathura and ran a bullion trading company in the city. According to his family, Neeraj, along with his wife and children, had been living in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar for the last six months. Police said Neeraj shifted to capital because of work pressure, and was looking after his business from here.

He and his family visited his in-laws in Mathura on Tuesday evening. Around 10 pm, Neeraj said they had to leave for Delhi as there was a function at his daughter’s school. They stopped for dinner at a restaurant close to Expressway, said a family member. Six hours later, their bodies were found in the car which was parked in a service lane close to Expressway.

Initially, police could not spot the bodies as the windows were fogged. When a policeman peered through a crack, he found three people covered in blood while the boy was still breathing. Police suspect the bullet went through him. “There is something odd about the whole scenario; the way they have been shot looks professional. It merits an investigation. Everything was normal when Neeraj left. Even if it is a suicide, we need to find out the truth,” said Tarun Agarwal, Neeraj’s relative.

According to police sources, Neeraj’s company was under the scanner for alleged fraudulent transactions following demonetisation. But family members claimed that a professional rival had planted fake complaints to harass Neeraj. Several notices were issued and the matter is pending in court, he said. Neeraj would even keep a licensed gun with two loaded magazines with him for protection, said the family member.

comments","Nine easy-to-avoid mistakes that gym newbies makeSee our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

According to the Fitness Industry Association, 12 per cent of gym memberships are taken out in January - and most people will have already stopped going withing six months.

And it is easy to see why: gyms can be daunting places for the initiated, full of monstrously heavy weights, bizarre looking machines and muscle-bound athletes pumping iron.

There is also a tempting array of ways to injure/embarrass yourself, all of which often leads to us either not going anymore, or simply cancelling our membership.

Devon Live caught up with former Exeter Chiefs player Sam Blythe, founder of Fitness Matters on Marsh Barton in Exeter, to offer some tips about how to avoid easy mistakes and make sure the gym is for life, not just for Christmas.

1) Too much too soon

""People are often so super keen when they join a gym in January that they are possibly just doing too much too soon. They need to take small steps.

""Some people are coming to the gym after a little while out, but others – with the best will in the world – are not so clued up and maybe take on too much too soon.

""It's much better to start slowly and take your time.""

2)It's good to talk

""It is worth having a chat with a few people, taking your time and getting some advice along the way. That will give you real structure and a plan. Then you are way more likely to keep it going.

""If you are somebody who has spent a lot of time in the gym but just lost a bit of momentum along the way then you probably won’t need any advice, but if you are new then speak to someone.

""Any environment you don’t know is daunting so sitting own and having a chat with someone who works there or a PT for a bit of confidence or guidance to get a nudge in the right direction is no bad thing.""

3) Plan your routine

""I would suggest those people who are new to a gym just give a little bit of thought to what you might do. A lot of people get on the gym floor, don’t know what they’re doing and end up just doing the same few exercises day after day. It pays to sit down the night before and have a think about it so you have a way forward.

""You want to be healthy for ever, not just January.""

4) Warm up...

""A warm-up is always going to help you.

""Make your warm-up specific to what you are going to do. There is no point in warming up a part of your body you are not then going to use.

""It needs to be specific to what you are going to do. If you want to improve your running, you are not going to just jump on a treadmill and start sprinting right away. It just needs a little bit of common sense.

5) ...and cool down

""Cooling down and stretching is often very overlooked. People often don’t do it because it is harder to see the benefits when you are doing it looking in the mirror.

""People often just want to lose weight and look better, but often stretching and cooling down will help you avoid injury and recover more quickly, which means you can spend more time exercising and, in the long run, will look better anyway.""

6) Be patient

""From a technical point of view, it is important not to rush into things without knowing what you are doing first. You could end up injuring yourself or not getting the results you hoped for.

""Mentally, it is just like going on a diet. When you try and change something overnight often it will only last for a week or two and then you get resentful and fall off the wagon and you are back to square one. You want to keep it sustainable, which begins with a steady start to get the snowball rolling.""

7) Find your lifestyle balance

""You have to find a lifestyle that is sustainable to yourself. That is different for everybody – what is a sacrifice to one person isn’t necessarily to another. It is about finding what works for you and sticking to that.""

8) Gym goals

""Different people have different ways of doing it. Some people are very goals-driven, and soon fall off the wagon if they don’t have something to aim for. Other people like just ticking over and staying fit.

""Overall, I think staying healthy is important, but if you can find a challenge to give you that little spike from time to time then that is great.""

9) An all-round approach to exercising

""In my opinion, it is about having the best all-round approach.

""It depends how structured you want to be when you start going to the gym and what your goals are, but the all-round package in terms of exercising and living is very important.

""You don’t have to be the master of everything. If you do 80 per cent of things right, the other 20 per cent will take care of itself.""

Xalapa, Ver.- En los últimos tres días, la Secretaría de Bienestar dispersó pagos a razón de entre 1,200 a 1,400 personas por día, de los programas federales.

The alleged assault on Mordechai Kreuzer in July was caught on camera and published by Hebrew media, leading to a backlash of accusations of police brutality.

PIID filed the indictment at the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court against Yaakov Sheetrit, who is accused of assault as well as obstruction of justice in the course of the subsequent probe.

Another officer who was also involved in the incident will have his case dealt with by a disciplinary tribunal, Haaretz reported.

The incident happened during a demonstration against the demolition of illegal buildings in the central city of Beit Shemesh, which has a large ultra-Orthodox community.

Sheetrit and other officers told a crowd of protesters to disperse from a parking lot and then allegedly began pushing and shoving them.

At one point their attention became focused on Kreuzer, and Sheetrit allegedly hit him in the face, then dragged him away to a patrol car, pulling him by his sidelock.

During the clash Kreuzer suffered injuries to his face, back, elbow, forearm, shoulder and pelvis.

Sheetrit was also injured, apparently falling over and requiring a cast for his leg. He later claimed that Kreuzer attacked him with punches and kicks and that he was also assaulted by other demonstrators, a claim not borne out by the video evidence.

Kreuzer was initially arrested and charged with assaulting an officer but released after the video came to light. He said that in the hours after his arrest, which happened on a Friday, he was further mistreated by police at the jail and forced to ride in a car on Shabbat.

Sheetrit was suspended from duties after the investigation opened.

At the time, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who had come under fire over accusation of police brutality against Ethiopian-Israelis, called the incident appalling and said he approved of the officer’s suspension.

Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, head of the Haredi political party Shas, said at the time the incident “bordered on anti-Semitism.”","Indore: Health dept to raise demand for more doctors and staffIndore: Struggling with the scarcity of doctors, the health department is preparing a demand letter to fill posts of doctors and staff in the hospitals and health centres in the district.

Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta, home to about 30 million people, with some train lines and one of the city's airports also shut.

Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency called on residents to leave flood-hit areas. 'The first priority is saving lives,' said agency head Doni Monardo.

A 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three more people died of hypothermia, according to the disaster agency.

'My son's body was covered with newspaper when my two other children passed by,' said Fadrid, who identified himself as the dead teen's father.

'People asked them whether they knew the victim. If they hadn't been passing by, we wouldn't have known my son had been killed,' he told AFP.

Among the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres (13 feet) after a river burst its banks.

Another victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city's outskirts.

'We have shut down power (in many areas) to avoid more electrical shocks,' Ikhsan Asaad, an official at state firm PLN, told AFP.

Asaad said he could not estimate how many residents had been affected by the power shutdown.

'We're currently focusing on taking measures to ensure people's safety,' he added.

Angelina Widiyanti was among scores of residents whose houses were flooded with their possessions ruined by the disaster.

'We've had flooding several times before but it was never this high,' she said from her home, where the power had been cut.

'We weren't prepared for this.'

Authorities said about 19,000 people were evacuated, but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta's satellite cities.

'We're evacuating people right now,' Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters.

'Everyone living near rivers should anticipate (more) flooding,' he added.

Images from across the region showed waterlogged homes and cars submerged in muddy floodwaters, while some people took to paddling in small rubber lifeboats or tyre inner-tubes to get around.

The disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when several dozen people were killed when the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia's rainy season, which started in late November.

On Wednesday, service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry.

Many flights were transferred to Jakarta's main Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.","Indonesia: Jakarta hit with deadly floodsAt least nine people died as Jakarta was hit with severe flooding over the New Year.

Torrential rain soaked tens of thousands of revelers as they waited for New Year's Eve fireworks in Indonesia's capital.The rains led to flooding across the city.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the monsoon rains and rising rivers had submerged at least 90 neighborhoods.

Thousands of people were displaced by flooding and a domestic airport was closed after water levels reached up to 3 meters (10 feet) in several places.

Wibobo said some of the deaths were due to hypothermia, but also included a 16-year-old high school student who was electrocuted by a power line.

Indonesia's state electricity utility said it had switched off power to hundreds of districts to prevent further electrocutions.

Authorities have deployed about 120,000 rescuers to help evacuate those affected and install mobile water pumps. Further flooding is expected with downpours forecast for the coming day.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told reporters his administration would push ahead with infrastructure projects on two major rivers, including a dam and a sluice, to prevent flooding in the city of 30 million people.

This was the worst flooding since 2013 when dozens of people were killed in monsoon rains.

A 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three more people died of hypothermia, according to the disaster agency.'My son's body was covered with newspaper when my two other children passed by,' said Fadrid, who identified himself as the dead teen's father.Among the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres (13 feet) after a river burst its banks.Angelina Widiyanti was among scores of residents whose houses were flooded with their possessions ruined by the disaster.","Thousands of people were displaced by flooding and a domestic airport was closed after water levels reached up to 3 meters (10 feet) in several places.Indonesia's state electricity utility said it had switched off power to hundreds of districts to prevent further electrocutions.Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told reporters his administration would push ahead with infrastructure projects on two major rivers, including a dam and a sluice, to prevent flooding in the city of 30 million people.aw/mm (AP, AFP, Reuters)

A New Year is upon us and let’s hope it’s without drama.

THE morning after the night before can be a revelation.

For the first time in decades, I woke up yesterday fairly well-rested and without a hangover.

Part of the reason was that, as a member of the dedicated Daily newsroom team, I had a 7am start. So apart from a restaurant dinner and re-run of the movie Jersey Boys, my New Year’s Eve was uneventful.

But I soon realised there was much more to my unusual disinterest in the celebrations.

The past few months, the pages of the Daily and our online space have seen so much tragedy in our neighbourhoods, natural disasters and heartache, I think I am in the throes of emotional fatigue.

I have so much empathy for the strangers who have lost loved ones, seen irreplaceable keepsakes burn in the rubble of their fire-torn homes, and who are valiantly fighting disease or are down on their luck.

I cry for the parents, children and mates who lose loved ones on the roads or to violence in their own homes.

I see vision of the walls of flames firefighters throughout the country are being faced with and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I see salt-of-the-earth people raising funds for charity, who later find themselves grappling with life-threatening disease. And there’s nothing I can do.

Celebrating life and a new year somehow felt a little off this time. I’m a glass half-full person and personally had a great 2019. But my wish for 2020 is for a boring year — one with fewer dramas for Coast residents, a major cut in the national road toll, no drought or flooding rains. And I’ll raise my early morning coffee cup instead to everyone’s good health and happiness.","New Year’s Eve on the Las Vegas Strip — PHOTOSRevelers packed the Las Vegas Strip to usher out 2019 and ring in 2020 on New Year’s Eve.

Sikh devotees at a procession on the occasion of Prakashotsava in Patna on Wednesday.

PATNA: Thousands of Sikh devotees on Wednesday participated in the ‘akhand path’ and ‘Nagar Kirtan’ at Gai Ghat gurdwara, which was followed by a ‘Shobha Yatra’ on the second day of three-day 353rd Prakashotsava celebrations to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.

The ‘Shobha Yatra’ which started from the Gai Ghat gurdwara at 2.30pm converged at Takht Shri Harmandir Sahib in Patna City late evening. During the yatra, devotees recited ‘Gurbaani’ from the Guru Granth Sahib on the beats of drums.

The band members of several schools including Guru Gobind Girl’s Middle and High School, Guru Gobind Boy’s Middle and High School, Guru Tegh Bahadur Academy and Guru Nanak School as well as orchestra members from Punjab enthralled the audience with their scintillating performances. Gatka (martial arts of Sikh) was also performed by the youths during the yatra.

Members of the gurdwara committee and locals put up stalls of refreshment between Gai Ghat gurdwara and Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib gurdwara to provide snacks, juice and water to the devotees. Horses, camels and elephants were also included in the procession.

On the occasion of Prakashotsava, all the gurdwaras in the city, including the Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib gurdwara, Gurdwara Sri Gai-ghat Sahib, Guru Ka Bagh gurdwara and Bal Leela gurdwara have been decked up with flowers and illuminated with lights.

A rush of devotees from India, Canada and Australia was witnessed at various locations in Patna City, including the Kangan Ghat and other gurdwaras. Many devotees also showed active participation in serving ‘langar’ to the people.

Manpreet Singh from Punjab said he along with his family will contribute their best during the three-day Prakashotsava. Another devotee Mahinder Singh, who, after celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in Rajgir, arrived in the city to attend Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary said, “Since I am a retired man, my wife and I have decided to participate in all such events.”

Daljeet Singh, superintendent of Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee said, “Langar was also arranged at Gai Ghat gurdwara for devotees. People of all religious groups have come out on streets to mark the Prakashotsava celebrations. The celebrations will continue till midnight of January 2,” he said.

There are different processes one must undergo for immigration, that some people get confused with all the to-dos in the checklist and ends up getting stressed about the littlest things. In planning for immigration, there are certain things that you should take note of.

The Immigration Process

Immigration to another country requires a due process that needs to be fulfilled. For countries like the U.S., their immigration process is lengthy and costly. The usual procedure for the immigration process is first, the acquiring of the immigrant visa to be eligible for legal permanent residency.

An immigrant visa can be acquired in four ways (on U.S. standards and legal procedures). These are family-based, employment-based, asylum and refugee status or diversity lottery.

Aside from the immigrant visa, it should be verified that the immigrant has no criminal records to be issued a legal permanent residency.

The processes for immigration can be too complex. Hiring an immigration attorney would not only lessen the burden on you, you can also be assured that the legal processes are duly followed.

As mentioned, the whole immigration process can be a bit complicated. To avoid unnecessary troubles along the way, here are some tips when planning for immigration to another place.

Tips in Planning for Immigration

All requested forms and information should be submitted in advance. Be certain that everything indicated are true and correct.

Be ready for any delays. Submitting the forms in an earlier date will buy you more time for preparation.

You should also have a copy of all the documents you have passed to the authorities.

Be respectful to immigration authorities and be on time if there are scheduled appointments or interviews.

Better to follow all the steps legally. Avoid any shortcut methods to prevent any trouble.

Hire an efficient and competent immigration lawyer. If your situation is complicated or you find the whole process overwhelming, then legal assistance would be needed. Your lawyer must be an expert in immigration cases.

Though the whole immigration process might be tiring and would require much effort, time and money, following these tips might alleviate some of the burden on you. Although the legal processes are important, better be prepared of other things you might encounter a problem with in the future.

Other Things to Consider in Planning for Immigration

You should have at least a brief background or knowledge about the country you are going to.

If the country or place you are planning to move on to speak a different language, better start learning the basics that would be enough for you to survive daily conversations.

Even if the whole process can be tedious, the primary advice for a successful immigration is persistence.","'s Island Potato Soap Company has come up with a new soap he hopes will appeal to some customers south of the border.Ijsselstein said he isn't political and created the soap as a humorous word play.Democratic soap?""It's amazing how many U.S. customers we have,"" he said.More P.E.I.","Tips when Planning for Immigration to Another Place| By

Emerging out of the ashes of the financial crisis, Bitcoin was created as a bypass to the banks and government agencies mired in Wall Street’s greatest calamity in decades. At first, it was slow to break through, muddied by a slew of scandals: fraud, thefts and scams that turned away many and brought closer regulatory scrutiny. But once it burst into the mainstream, it proved to be the decade’s best-performing asset.

The largest digital token, trading around $7,200, has posted gains of more than 9,000,000% since July 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Bitcoin really captured that wild technology enthusiasm that ‘this time is different,’” said Peter Atwater, the president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.

The performance over the past 10 years, even with its huge run-up and subsequent mega-crash, leaves all others in the dust. It’s a massive windfall for those who — to use the lingo of the crypto crowd — HODL’ed through its ups and downs, even as it continues to provide fodder for get-rich-quick schemes. For some, the never-ending fantasy of continually hitting that payoff still helps to keep Bitcoin’s momentum going.

Nothing else comes even close to beating it. The S&P 500 merely tripled in that period. An index that tracks world markets has more than doubled. Gold is up 25%. Some of the best-performing stocks in the Russell 3000 — including Exact Sciences Corp. and Intelligent Systems Corp. — are each up about 3,000%. Those gains pale in comparison to the finance world’s latest — and one of its most controversial -- marvels.

Partly, the monster return is a reflection of the calculus behind Bitcoin’s jumping-off point: the token wasn’t worth anything when someone named Satoshi Nakamoto launched it on Halloween 2008. Designed as a method of exchange that can be sent electronically between users around the world, it did not have a centralized control network. Bitcoin, instead, is run by a network of computers that keep track of all transactions on the blockchain ledger. For many, that technology was reason enough to buy into the idea.

On the other side of the equation are Bitcoin’s devoted enthusiasts who saw in its technology a promising way to change the global financial system.

“This is the first time that there’s a real separation — just like church and state — you have a separation of money and state,” said Alex Mashinsky, founder of Celsius Network, a crypto lending platform. “That’s the innovation, that’s the excitement.”

But Bitcoin was slow to take off, notching its first transaction two years after its creation, when someone used it to buy pizza. Since then, the first-born token’s price has catapulted, doubling many times over, and hundreds of imitators have cropped up — some with more success than others.

Many of those who got in early stayed faithful, watching as it made its way through a boom and bust cycle unrivaled by almost anything else over the last decade.

At the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin jumped above $1,000. By mid-summer, it had more than doubled. Insanity was unleashed. By year-end, it hovered above $14,000. But as swiftly as it ran up, it fell even faster. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin barely budged above $3,000. Yet shortly after its crash, it embarked on another huge rally, this time reaching as high as $13,800 in the summer of 2019.

“Certainly the numbers are what appeals to investors,” said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. “The next 10 years need to be a totally different stage of growth based on totally different factors than the first stage.”

As much as it’s made a fortune for speculators and some thieves, Bitcoin’s survival will rest on further adoption. It’s not being used as a widespread medium of exchange. A few large retailers are accepting payment in Bitcoin but there hasn’t been the large-scale embrace so many had predicted. Scams are still running rampant. Interest is waning and consolidation among large owners is at a higher level than it was during the height of the 2017 bubble, which means that their influence over prices could be increasing.

Projections for the next decade abound. In the 2020s, mass adoption is surely to take off, they say. Blockchain technology will revolutionize and solve every problem in the world. On the other hand, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with central bankers paying closer attention than ever before.

In the more immediate term, some speculators forecast 2020 might be less fraught with volatility given its upcoming halving, whereby the number of coins awarded to so-called miners who process transactions is cut by 50%. That’s set to happen in May 2020 (the internet is replete with countdown clocks). The coin’s previous cut, about four years ago, coincided with a run-up in its price, pushing many crypto evangelist to believe in a repeat.

To CoinList’s Andy Bromberg, the halving is already priced in. “Maybe it’s been overpriced in and everyone’s bought into this thesis and we see a dip post-halving,” said the firm’s co-founder and president in an interview. “That would not shock me.”

But beyond next year, “Bitcoin is finding its own narrative as digital gold,” he said. “It feels like that narrative is picking up steam and it’s breaking away on its own. I would define success for most crypto assets as doing exactly that.”","Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia’s markets in your inbox every morning?

Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia’s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over Bitcoin’s bull run last decade. Here are some of the things people in the markets are talking about today.

Get Out

Thousands of tourists holidaying on the south coast of Australia’s New South Wales state have been told to evacuate before the weekend when extreme weather is set to intensify deadly wildfires sweeping through the region. In an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of the state should get out in the next two days. The 230-kilometer (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, producing apocalyptic scenes as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities. At least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales just this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Right now, isolated communities in Victoria remain cut off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through. Military helicopters and ships have been scrambled to bring in supplies and for potential evacuations if roads can’t be re-opened.

“Pay for the Pains”

Kim Jong Un declared he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major missile tests and would soon debut a “new strategic weapon,” adding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign policy concerns in a politically charged election year. The North Korean leader told a gathering of party officials in Pyongyang that U.S. actions left him no choice but to reconsider commitments that underpinned three unprecedented meetings with Trump over the past 18 months, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday. Kim called for “shocking actual action” to make the U.S. “pay for the pains” suffered by North Korea under the Washington-led sanctions regime, KCNA said. The speech came during an unusual four-day party meeting and appeared to replace the televised address Kim has delivered every New Year’s Day since 2013. Kim is seeking sanctions relief and security guarantees that the Trump administration has so far refused to provide without a disarmament commitment from Pyongyang.

Markets Wait

Traders eyed a cautious start on Thursday in Asia as they assessed the latest policy move by China’s central bank and awaited data on the country’s manufacturing sector. Australia’s dollar and the yen edged lower. Activity is set to pick up as most global markets reopen from holiday closures on Jan. 1, though Japanese equities remain shut for the remainder of this week. The People’s Bank of China on Wednesday said it will increase the supply of cheap funding to banks, a move of policy support in line with market expectations. Markets start this year on the back of a strong performance for global stocks and sovereign bonds in 2019. Thursday gives investors the latest read on Chinese manufacturing with the Caixin manufacturing PMI expected to hover around its November level — remaining well in the expansionary zone. Elsewhere, crude fell 1% to $61.06 a barrel on Dec. 31, and gold was at $1,517.29 an ounce.

Unbeatable Bitcoin

If in the throes of this bull market’s earliest stages of recovery someone told you to forgo stocks, forget commodities, renounce fixed-income assets and buy an unknown digital token, the first of its kind, and watch it grow beyond your wildest dreams, you’d call them crazy, right?

They allege that on December 7 2018 at Lloyd’s Pharmacy, Longford Shopping Centre, Longford, Mr Hannafin carried out a Section 3 assault on a man causing him harm.

It’s also alleged on the same date, Mr Hannafin produced a knife contrary to Section 11 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.

A third charge relating to a Section 16 affray charge was also added to the indictment.

Judge Seamus Hughes gave Mr Hannafin the alibi warning, telling him he must provide to the State within 14 days details of any alibi he intends to rely on in the course of his trial.

Mr Hannafin was remanded on continuing bail as a result to the next sittings of Longford Circuit Criminal Court on January 14 2020.","My stepfather wants to move his new wife into my late mother’s house: Can I ‘kick her out’ after he dies?Dear Moneyist,

My mother passed away last year. I share the title of my mother’s home with my stepfather, but he wants to get married again and wants his new wife to move into the house. What happens when he dies? Does she have any right to the house or can I kick her out immediately after he dies?

Vanessa

Dear Vanessa,

Given that he’s about to have another chance at love and in the holiday spirit and interest of decorum, let’s start by wishing them the best in their new lives together and hope they both live long and happy lives. It’s nice that he doesn’t have to be alone anymore and is able to share the remainder of his life with a woman he loves.

Also see:As a baby boomer, I didn’t grow up with this culture of entitlement — do I have to leave my estate to my children or spouse?

If you and your stepfather’s names are listed on the title deeds of your mother’s former home, he owns 50%. His new wife would be his legal heir and, for better or for worse, you would end up owning the house with this woman. If he is a tenant for life, then the 50% of your mother’s former home would pass to you when he dies, assuming you are an only child.

Recommended: ‘What did he do with all the money?’ My dying husband cashed his $700K life insurance and emptied his bank accounts

In the meantime, I would like to gently suggest welcoming your stepfather’s new wife into your lives as a member of your extended family. Try, if you can, to put this territorial approach to one side for now. You don’t know this woman. What if she is warm and caring and wants for nothing except the love and support of her husband and his family?

Don’t miss: I discovered through Ancestry.com that my biological father is someone else — can I claim an inheritance as his heir?

At the very least, it will help the years pass without rancor and bitterness. If he invites you to the wedding, raise a glass to their health and happiness. Who knows, they may enrich your life in ways you could not have imagined and that go beyond the half share of your mother’s property. You may even find yourself wishing that they both stick around for a very long time.

This assurance has come from Attorney General Dale Marshall, who promised to “redouble” his efforts to tackle the crime situation and achieve greater efficiency within the crime fighting agency.

“The Royal Barbados Police Force will also be redoubling its efforts,” Marshall told Barbados TODAY, adding that for him, 2020 will be about “action and achieving results”

The length of time it takes to get a police certificate of character has been a major concern. Marshall said he would be meeting with Commissioner of Police Tyrone Griffith on Tuesday to thrash out those and other issues affecting the RBPF.

Pointing out that there has been a deficit in the Force for over two decades, Marshall said they would also be finding ways to make the profession more attractive and to better mobilize resources to bring about solutions.

“But until that happens, and we can recruit the additional numbers that we need, we have to do things differently,” he said.

“So, for example, the police certificate of character takes up to six police officers. We are completely automating that. Over the next five to six weeks you will see a whole new computer-driven mechanism for getting police certificates of character, which will see them coming out in a matter of days and actually being emailed back to you. We have developed an application so you can actually make the application on your mobile phone,” he explained.

The Attorney General also said that come next year, police officers would also stop responding to minor accidents.

“Those matters are really matters best left to insurance companies because at the end of the day it is really about who is going to pay. Those are not the kinds of things people get charge for,” he said.

“So police will continue to go to fatal accidents and serious accidents, but the run of the mill accidents – somebody bounced your car in a carpark and you are not moving until the police comes – that takes up valuable policing time,” said Marshall.

This, he suggested, would allow officers to tackle more serious issues.

“So, when it comes to us being able to strategically and holistically reduce all levels of crime and, especially in relation to murders, how we deploy our manpower is going to be key and we are going to be rolling out a whole set of initiatives to take care of that,” he said.

With mere hours to go before 2019 comes to a close, there have been a record 49 murders in Barbados.

Despite the “unprecedented” number of killings, most of which were executed through gunplay, Marshall told Barbados TODAY he was satisfied enough was being done to bring the situation under control.

“Of course there has been enough action this year. The members of the police force have worked more than assiduously in terms of investigations,” he said.

The trained attorney explained that “a lot of things that don’t make the Press” were happening, including several successful intelligence-driven operations leading to the seizure of illegal weapons and the stemming of firearm importation.

“We know, though, that there has been an accumulation of firearms on our streets over the last decade. Our mission is to ferret those out and to ferret out those individuals who have been using them. So there are things that have been going on that have been achieving results for us,” insisted Marshall.

“I know as the year ends everyone is concerned about the high level of murder rates. Forty-nine murders in any year is unprecedented for Barbados, but I want Barbadians to stay the course.

“We have put, in difficult financial times, extraordinary financial resources for the police. We are gradually changing how the police do things so as to free up manpower to deal with the more serious things,” assured Marshall.

[email protected]","Ray Sefo's bucket list for 2020 includes signing more big name fightersNEW YORK – PFL president Ray Sefo is looking to build on his roster.

The 2019 PFL Championship took place at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, marking one of the biggest shows in the promotion’s short history. Once again, six fighters walked away with world titles and $1 million.

And having recently signed former Bellator welterweight champion Rory MacDonald, Sefo said the goal is to continue to sign some marquee names in the sport.

“(I want to) sign more big name fighters (and) continue to grow,” Sefo said at the post-fight news conference. “But my phone was going off like crazy throughout the show because everybody got to see the PFL show tonight and got to see all the champions get crowned.

“It just goes to show that we’re continuing to grow. And then adding someone like Rory to the mix, the sky’s the limit for PFL – and there’s a lot of discussions with other people that are interested and want to come over.”

Also on the agenda moving forward is the possibility of superfights. Featherweight champ Lance Palmer and lightweight champ Natan Schulte were two names that were brought up as suggestions for a potential superfight, and while only Palmer seemed quite keen, Sefo likes the idea in general.

“There’s a lot in the works for PFL, and those were part of discussions along the way,” Sefo said. “Not necessarily Natan and Lance, but we talked about doing some superfights and whatnot. But that’s part of the plan. Whether it happens next year or the year after that, I’m not sure exactly. But there are discussions in terms of putting on some superfights.”

The ESPN deal was arguably the biggest development for the promotion this year, giving the fighters the largest platform possible, to showcase their skills.

“ESPN has been great,” Sefo said. “I mean, they’ve been a great partner and the fact we’re on ESPN speaks volumes. It just goes to show that – and it sends a message out there – that PFL is here and that we’re alive and well and we’re going to continue to sign some big names and continue to grow.”","We have developed an application so you can actually make the application on your mobile phone,” he explained.“So police will continue to go to fatal accidents and serious accidents, but the run of the mill accidents – somebody bounced your car in a carpark and you are not moving until the police comes – that takes up valuable policing time,” said Marshall.“So, when it comes to us being able to strategically and holistically reduce all levels of crime and, especially in relation to murders, how we deploy our manpower is going to be key and we are going to be rolling out a whole set of initiatives to take care of that,” he said.“I know as the year ends everyone is concerned about the high level of murder rates.We are gradually changing how the police do things so as to free up manpower to deal with the more serious things,” assured Marshall.","The 2019 PFL Championship took place at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, marking one of the biggest shows in the promotion’s short history.Featherweight champ Lance Palmer and lightweight champ Natan Schulte were two names that were brought up as suggestions for a potential superfight, and while only Palmer seemed quite keen, Sefo likes the idea in general.“Not necessarily Natan and Lance, but we talked about doing some superfights and whatnot.But that’s part of the plan.It just goes to show that – and it sends a message out there – that PFL is here and that we’re alive and well and we’re going to continue to sign some big names and continue to grow.”",,

Imagine having to get all of your groceries from a gas station or local corner store bodega where you're forced to select bags of chips and frozen pizza as sustenance. This is the reality for the millions of citizens who live in food deserts in the United States. The United States lacks equal access to food across communities and food availability is scarce in portions of the country known as food deserts.

In 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture performed a food access study and defined a US food desert as an area where 33 percent of a city’s residents live more than one mile from a supermarket and 20 percent earn below the poverty line. Many residents of food desert locations do not have cars and lack access to public transportation, making them essentially unable to get to a grocery store. Food desert causes are mostly related to economics. Big chain supermarkets have a hard time turning a profit in impoverished areas, which results in places without food cropping up across the country. The effects are devastating. The obesity rates in these areas are generally higher, meaning life-threatening illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are on the rise. Luckily, new laws and various grassroots organizations are currently working to make healthy, affordable food available nationwide. On a local level, many cities have not just opened up food co-ops and food markets in impoverished areas. Local corner stores are also expanding their inventory. Instead of using all of their shelf space for junk food, they are providing more healthy fresh food options.

According to Korean Entertainment News platform Soompi, the report was confirmed by the news outlet, Market News which published a report at midnight KST on January 2 stating that according to their investigation, they were exclusively reporting that Momo and Heechul are dating.

Market News is the outlet that reported in August that Momo and Heechul were in a relationship, and in the January 2 report they mentioned that Super Junior's Label and JYP Entertainment had denied that they are dating at the time.

Kim Heechul and Momo have been seen together on several shows, like Weekly Idol which featured Heechul as a temporary host and Momo as part of her girlgroup, Twice several times. Momo has also been on Knowing Bros, with him. Most of the times on these shows, Heechul has been really impressed by Momo, who hails from Japan and is a dancer. One of the video clips which went viral at the time of an episode of Weekly Idol airing was a clip where Momo re-enacts a Japanese character saying 'Nicco nicco ni,' to do aego, a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.

As news of them confirmed to be dating broke, fans couldn't be happier, being super supportive despite of some pointing out that Kim Heechul and Momo have an age difference of 13 years. 'Momo' became a Twitter trend worldwide as fans woke up to the news.

‌Francis lost his cool when the woman abruptly grabbed his hand and yanked him towards her just after he reached out to greet a child during a visit to the Vatican’s nativity scene on Tuesday night.

The woman would not let go of him and in a gesture that appeared to cause him pain, he slapped at her hand before pulling his hand free.

During his Angelus address to a packed St Peter’s Square on New Year’s Day, the pontiff referred to his actions. “I apologise for the bad example yesterday … sometimes even I lose patience”, he said.

The identity of the woman is unknown, but a video of the incident went viral, sparking indignation on social media. One Twitter user wrote: “What the pope did demonstrates one thing – he’s a man.”

In his address on Wednesday morning, the pope also condemned violence against women. He said: “By how we treat a woman’s body, we can understand our level of humanity.”

In another clip that went viral earlier this year, Pope Francis repeatedly yanked his hand away from being kissed by a long queue of people. The waiting pilgrims had been attempting to kiss his papal ring as part of a tradition, practised by more conservative Catholics, to show respect to the pontiff.

A few days after the incident, the Vatican said Francis had been worried about spreading germs. However, experts said at the time that his reluctance to have his papal ring kissed reflected an uneasiness with an element of traditional protocol that had lost its original meaning.","WATCH: Pope Francis Slaps Woman's Hand on New Year's EvePope Francis found himself at the center of controversy on New Years Eve after he slapped a woman’s hand for grabbing him and not letting go.

Quebec lottery fans have celebrated quite the cash windfalls over the past twelve months, with bigger and better lotto jackpots making their way to their pockets. Lotto 6/49 was once again among the preferred tickets purchased by many Canadians, but it seemed like many of the cash prizes were eventually drawn to the eastern regions of the country.

Today we are going to review some of the heftiest Lotto 6/49 jackpots bagged by Quebec players this year. Purchasing tickets as a group has made the entire gaming experience more special for Canadians, as it makes them feel part of a community that could soon become much richer. This is also true for tickets purchased by couples that have agreed to split the jackpot and invest it in something both individuals would find enjoyable.

Such was the case with a couple hailing from Gatineau that became eligible for a cash windfall of CA$7 million mid-July. Just like many winners before them, the two Lotto 6/49 enthusiasts were in a state of disbelief upon realizing their lives would never be the same again. Colette Laberge and Mario Lafrenière collected their jackpot and took a photo with the hefty cheque at Casino du Lac-Leamy.

The winging draw for the two of them took place on July 10, highlighting the numbers 07, 15, 22, 28, 43, 49, plus the bonus one 45. Matching the six main numbers sufficed, making their ticket a lucky one indeed. Winners revealed that they had purchased the winning ticket at Uniprix Danyel Dessureault, Place de la Cité-des-Jeunes.

According to Loto-Quebec’s regulation, every retail point associated with a winning purchase is eligible for a 1-percent slice of the jackpot. This granted the location some CA$70,000, a motivation for many retailers to include lottery offerings in their array of offerings. One of the regular questions, when winners collect their prize, is related to their plans. The Gatineau couple had already come up with a plan that included treating their extended family as well.

Larger Prizes Claimed

Another permanent resident of Quebec would forever remember this year as a special one thanks to his lucky Lotto 6/49 ticket purchase. The first days of August were special for Daniel Lavoie of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean who was the proud winner of CA$3.5 million jackpot. This was half of the August 7 Lotto 6/49 Main prize, but still a generous cash pile for the Canadian.

August 7 brought a Lotto 6/49 draw coming with a CA$7-million prize that was eventually split between the two tickets eligible for it. The numbers drawn at that draw were 05, 08, 09, 19, 28, 31, plus the bonus one 18. Mr. Lavoie purchased his ticket at the Couche-Tard convenience store in Chambord ahead of the lucky draw.

Just like every other retail location selling winging tickets, the convenience store received one percent of the payout. In this case this amounted to CA$35,000 piece of the Main prize. The lotto millionaire was certain that he would continue working at least for the time being, despite the windfall. He also began looking for the perfect new home for his family.","Here are the Lotto and Lotto Plus resultsHere are the winning Lotto and Lotto Plus numbers from the Wednesday, January 1 draw:

But to the obvious surprise of many U.S. experts, Kim hedged on making any move that would cross a red line for the Trump administration or the Pentagon. Instead, he left the door open for further negotiations over peace and denuclearization – but only if the United States “rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK” and helps build “a lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism” on the peninsula.

In some ways, Kim’s remarks restated the regime’s long-standing policy on talking to Washington, with an extra dose of determination to withstand the withering U.S. and UN sanctions that have crippled Kim’s attempts to remake North Korea’s economy and stifled any moves towards inter-Korean reconciliation over the last two years. “The DPRK-U.S. stand-off which has lasted century after century has now been compressed to clear stand-off between self-reliance and sanctions,” he said.

If that situation continues, Kim declared, the “long confrontation” with the U.S. might include the introduction “in the near future” of a “new strategic weapon” that he declined to describe (apart from being capable of “shocking actual action.”) Moreover, he would show his new hand by ending the halt he declared in 2018 to further development of nuclear weapons and the “test-fire” of long-range ICBMs capable of hitting the United States. “There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to that commitment any longer,” he said.

To make the case for ending the moratorium, Kim pointed to the “big and small” military drills carried out by the U.S. military in and around Korea since the talks began in 2018, and its introduction of “ultra-modern warfare equipment” from the United States into South Korea. As he spoke, a fleet of U.S. spy planes, based primarily in nearby Okinawa and carrying the most sophisticated surveillance equipment in the world, combed Korean skies looking for any signs of new tests that would violate the moratorium.

Read the original article.","Here’s North Korea’s New Year’s gift to the worldWe didn’t wind up getting that Christmas present from Kim Jong-un that he promised. (Not even the vase that President Trump suggested.) While most of us were expecting either a weapon’s test or a missile launch, all remained quiet in the hermit nation for the remainder of the year. But this morning the dictator released a statement through his country’s state-run media outlets that appears to explain what the real “present” was going to be. As of today, North Korea is no longer considering itself bound to the weapons testing moratorium agreed to between Kim and Trump. (NY Times)

North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, ​said his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests… North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States — and his budding personal relationship with President Trump — would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.

Kim was still being rather vague about what he plans to do, but he promised that the world would soon see a “new strategic weapon” being deployed from the Korean Peninsula. (The Hill)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the world will witness “a new strategic weapon” from the isolated nation in the “near future” as nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang are stuck in a stalemate. According to reports of his remarks from North Korean state media, Kim blasted the U.S. for its “hostile policy” toward North Korea and said he had no expectation Washington would lift sanctions on his country soon.

Reached for comment at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump appeared to discount the threat, saying that he still believes Kim Jong-un is “a man of his word” and will find a way to close the deal. Of course, that’s pretty much been Trump’s modus operandi throughout this entire process. Keep flattering Kim while refusing to give in to his demands. And Trump will no doubt continue to play nice until it’s time get tough.

As long as North Korea is only talking about violating the agreement and not actually doing it, there’s still time to cut a deal. It’s even conceivable that Trump could put some small concession on the table along the lines of a partial withdrawal of one or two minor sanctions. That would at least give Kim something to take home and claim a victory if he’s willing to at least continue the moratorium, if not actually start dismantling his nukes.

But in reality, those nukes are the only thing keeping Kim in power, at least in his view. It’s almost impossible to conceive of him really carrying through on a comprehensive denuclearization program.

So if he doesn’t, what might the “new strategic weapon” be? Intelligence analysts seem to think it will be one of two things. Either he’ll light off a fully functional hydrogen bomb or he’ll test an ICBM with solid fuel propellant that can definitely make it all the way across the Pacific to the west coast of the United States. Either one would be provocative in the extreme and send us right back to where we were stuck before Trump reached out to him.

2020 may be starting off on an upward path domestically but in terms of our negotiations with North Korea, we’re already hitting a sour note. And with Russia and China courting Kim’s favor these days, I’m not particularly hopeful of the situation improving any time soon.","North Korea's Warning to America: End Your 'Hostile Policy' Or Get NothingIn the most anticipated speech of his career today, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un told hundreds of cadre from the Workers’ Party of Korea to prepare for a long-term standoff with the United States over its drive to “seek its own political and diplomatic interests” in Korea while “wasting time away under the signboard of dialogue and negotiations.”

en,en,1484010878_1484010762,4,4,1,3.5,4,2,2,"10 years after surgery, Ryan Westmoreland lands coaching job at UMass-DartmouthThis coming March, it will have been 10 years since Ryan Westmoreland experienced the scariest day of his life. He was on an operating table at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix as Dr. Robert Spetzler prepped for a five-hour procedure to remove a cavernous malformation on his brain stem.

At the time, Westmoreland was the No. 1 prospect in the Boston Red Sox organization and the 21st-ranked minor league player in all of baseball. But as doctors started to put the former Portsmouth High School star under anesthesia, his thoughts didn’t drift toward a future career in the bigs and he wasn’t dwelling on when he’d get back on the field.

He was praying he’d make it through alive.

Nearly a decade has passed since March 16, 2010 — the date of that surgery, which is emblazoned on his arm with a tattoo — and on the anniversary, Westmoreland will be back on the field as an assistant coach on Bob Prince’s staff at UMass Dartmouth.

“It was perfect. I had lost two of my assistant coaches to head coaching jobs, and I had been passively looking [to replace them],” Prince said. “The timing couldn’t have been any better. I reached out to Ryan and it went from there. We had a nice conversation in regards to the program and his role, his expectations.”

Westmoreland is currently working with teenage players with the Ocean State Makos, an AAU team. And, in a way, that’s how he ended up with the Corsairs. He was touting some of his players to Rian McCarthy, an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with UMass Dartmouth. McCarthy, who had previously coached the Post 18 American Legion team in Newport, asked Westmoreland if he had considered coaching at the next level.

“I said absolutely,” Westmoreland said. “I wasn’t reaching out for jobs, but he asked me if I’d be interested, I talked with Coach Prince and it snowballed from there. I’m excited.”

When Westmoreland’s professional baseball career ended in 2013, he never envisioned himself as a coach. But after starting with the Portsmouth High School freshman team in 2015, then working with the Makos, he realized he could impart his vast knowledge of the game on the next generation of future stars.

And he found it quite enjoyable.

“When I retired, I wasn’t dead set on being a coach,” Westmoreland said. “The first year I coached, I said to myself, ‘I have a lot of knowledge and things I can teach.’ Not only the physical, but also the mental part of the game. I can teach what I’ve learned and then watch them to grow up and be successful.”

Westmoreland was a star at Portsmouth High School, twice named the state’s Gatorade Player of the Year, before graduating in 2008. That year, he was chosen by the Red Sox in the fifth round of the MLB First-Year Player draft. A five-tool player with tremendous potential, Westmoreland by the end of his second professional season was named the club’s top prospect.

But early in 2010, he felt tingling in his fingers and realized something wasn’t right. Westmoreland had a cavernous malformation on his brain stem that required a dangerous surgical procedure. He attempted a comeback and was invited to Red Sox spring training in 2011, but a second surgery forced him to give up the game he loves so much at just 22 years old.

There were some dark times, but Westmoreland found solace in coaching. Now he’ll take the next step in what he hopes is a lifelong endeavor. With UMass Dartmouth, Westmoreland said he won’t have a defined role, but is willing to do what is asked of him.

″[Coach Prince] just said, ‘We want you to be part of our program,’ And that was huge for me, because I’ve never coached in college,” Westmoreland said. “It looks like whatever I can do to help the team, and whatever Coach Prince wants me to do, I’m happy to do it.”

Prince knows what he’s getting in Westmoreland.

“He brings a lot,” Prince said. “Just the experience in terms of playing and the process and the grind that these kids go through. And he’s been working with kids who are at a high level. He’s been successful at developing players, and that’s what we’re about — developing players and people.”

Prince said Westmoreland isn’t hesitant to talk about what happened 10 years ago, and that most of the players already know his story. Infielder JR DiSarcina is the son of Gary DiSarcina, who was the manager of the Lowell Spinners when Westmoreland was with the club in 2009.

“When [the players] caught wind of what was going on, we were all on a group text, and one of the players said, ‘Oh my God, I have his rookie card and he autographed it for me.’ The kids know who he is,” Prince said.

For Westmoreland, this coaching position could be a stepping stone.

“I really hope it opens that door,” Westmoreland said. “Ever since I started coaching, I knew I wanted a future in this. I was looking to get into the college baseball world, and we’ll see where it goes from there. But this is a great opportunity.”

And he has a backer in Prince.

“He wants to be involved in baseball at a high level, whether it’s coaching in college, professionally or scouting,” Prince said. “My job, as it is with my players, is to help him get him to where he wants to go.”","Two-time Semi Finalist Vera Zvonareva to Miss Australian OpenFormer World No. 2 Vera Zvonareva will miss the Australian Open - the first Grand Slam of the 2020 season - due to problems with her left wrist.

Updated

Victorian authorities are ramping up efforts to reach and evacuate cut-off communities in East Gippsland, where 28 people remain missing after destructive bushfires tore through the region.

Key points: Remote communities across the region are either evacuating in convoys or preparing to stay and defend

In one isolated town, several residents are relying on a single shared radio at the general store

For the latest information, visit the Vic Emergency website

Premier Daniel Andrews said 24 Victorian communities were still isolated by bushfires on Thursday afternoon.

Rescue crews were battling to clear roads to reach them so they could evacuate before the risk increased this weekend, he said.

Nine satellite phones had also been dropped into other isolated communities.

This morning, Mr Andrews said the number of people missing in bushfire-affected areas in Victoria had risen from 17 to 28.

""I can confirm today that as at 9:30am, there are 28 people that we cannot locate, and we are very concerned about their wellbeing,"" Mr Andrews told a press conference in Melbourne.

Earlier, a body found in a home at Buchan was identified as 67-year-old Mick Roberts.

Thirty-nine firefighters from North America landed in Melbourne on Thursday afternoon to join the battle to control the East Gippsland blazes.

The charity group Need for Feed has also organised fodder to be dropped across East Gippsland to help isolated farmers trying to stop their livestock from starving.

On Friday morning some of the 4,000 people trapped in the coastal town of Mallacoota were transported to a Navy ship that arrived in the area the previous day.

They will be evacuated from Mallacoota to Western Port, at Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula, a journey that is expected to take 17 hours.

Dirt-road convoy gets out of Cann River

A convoy of 46 cars and a bus left Cann River on Thursday afternoon after residents were told trying to leave on Saturday would be extremely dangerous.

The convoy, which included emergency vehicles, was able to leave after crews cleared an old dirt track out of town.

Alison Rainey, who owns a local cafe, said they were all headed to the town of Orbost.

She said some residents who were undecided about leaving had opted to join the convoy after they were told at a briefing that Saturday would be an extremely dangerous day for the town.

Ms Rainey — who has decided to stay in Cann River — said her 10-year-old son was with his father in Bonnie Doon.

""Now that the town population has plummeted there's plenty [of food] to go around,"" she told ABC Statewide Drive.

She said she planned to take shelter in the school if things worsened.

""I feel confident that the school will be fine, that we will be protected here, I have no doubt about that.""

Nowa Nowa residents share single radio

Further west, several residents in Nowa Nowa have been relying on a single shared radio at a general store to monitor bushfire warnings.

Nowa Nowa General Store owner Sandra Huggins said the town was confronted by a ""massive wall of fire"" on Tuesday. She is now concerned about what will happen this weekend.

""Our community hasn't had power since Monday evening,"" she said.

""Because we have no power or phones or internet we're not getting any of the emergency warnings.

""If we got out of town a few Ks, we all of sudden get 'ping, ping, pings' and all these messages.

""It's a bit disconcerting to learn you're on Watch and Act, which you didn't even know.""

A passing tradie left them with a decent radio, which is now located in the only part of town with reception — in the car park outside the store.

""We don't get radio reception in our store or in our house,"" Ms Huggins said.

""That's our only contact with what's happening, we have no idea otherwise.

""It's very scary, especially with what happened on Monday night and what may happen.""

In the meantime, the community is cooking up the food from their defrosting freezers at a barbecue outside the shop.

""We're happy to feed anyone who wants to come and eat it,"" Ms Huggins said.

Those left in Genoa will face the fires alone

Just north-west of Mallacoota, the small community of Genoa has found itself completely cut off from Victorian authorities as a result of the fires.

CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said Victorian firefighters had asked their NSW counterparts to help, but even they could not reach the town.

He said a police officer had driven from Eden through the fire to get into Genoa and help the community as it was hit by the same blaze that devastated Mallacoota.

On Wednesday, authorities said about 100 people were trapped in Genoa.

David Sykes, who runs the nearby Wallagaraugh River Retreat, said he told his 56 guests to leave the holiday park on Sunday.

He said properties in the area had been destroyed, but most residents had already fled over the border to Eden.

""That is very, very sad, because as much as the fire out in the open has died down and is under control and in private land, you know, now the sad stories are starting to come out,"" he said.

Orbost serving as a point of refuge

The town of Orbost, which sits between Bairnsdale and Mallacoota, is serving as the main point of refuge for people leaving some of East Gippsland's more remote communities.

But some people remain trapped in remote communities to the north, such as Goongerah and Bonang.

Further west, a major relief centre at the Bairnsdale saleyards has been filling up with bushfire evacuees and about 250 horses.

East Gippsland Mayor John White said a backup centre may be needed at the local racecourse.

Metung told 'we need to evacuate'

Victorian authorities have told communities to the south and south-east of the Bairnsdale complex of fires that they are under threat and should leave as soon as possible before this weekend's weather hits.

That message was hardened by Metung CFA Captain Trevor Blundell on Thursday, who told a local meeting that the town needed to be evacuated.

""We are not safe in Metung. We are not safe in Metung. We need to evacuate this town,"" he told a crowd through a speaker on one of the brigade's trucks.

""Holidaymakers, residents, all these people in front of me looking at me, we need to leave Metung.""

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Thursday none of the 17 people missing in the region are emergency services personnel.

The increased number comes after family members confirmed Buchan man Mick Roberts had died at his home.

""There are at least 17 people that at this stage we cannot account for. Their whereabouts are unknown to us, plus there is one person confirmed as deceased,"" Andrews told reporters at Bairnsdale.

""Whilst Victoria Police have not been through the official identification processes, it is clear that the Roberts family have identified Mr Roberts and we send our condolences to their family and the Buchan community to whom he was so well-known and very highly regarded.""

About 50,000 homes are without power, phone networks are down, major supermarkets are closed and there are reports of people are queuing up to three hours to get food.

Fuel is also running low. Two tankers came in late yesterday and there's a ration to allow motorists enough to fuel up and get out.

This comes as the Rural Fire Service has issued a map of highlighting an area 250km long from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, where tourists were being asked to leave.

There's a 24-hour window today to evacuate the region before extreme fire conditions return on Saturday.

Motorists are now able to travel north on the Princes Highway from Batemans Bay. A reduced speed limit of 60km/h is in place.

Fireys say there's 'no hope' of containing blazes before Saturday. Three watch and acts on South Coast. 110 fires burning across NSW, half of them uncontained.

Seven people have died so far in these fires since Monday and 176 homes have been lost.

A 72-year-old man remains unaccounted for at Belowra, about 50km north west of Cobargo.

Residents in Australian towns ravaged by the bushfires have gone into 'panic stations' following 'apocalyptic' blazes that left 50,000 families without power and entire towns with a contaminated water supply.

Desperate locals and tourists were clearing shelves in supermarkets and filling up their fuel on Wednesday.

Weather conditions are expected to worsen by Saturday and there are currently road closures impacting traffic in and out of fire-affected communities across the New South Wales south coast and parts of Victoria.

Water supplies in both states have been contaminated in some areas, while it is simply running out all together in others.

One woman who was in the town of Tura Beach phoned the ABC and described the situation as 'panic stations'.

'A car queue of 50 waiting to get petrol and people in Woolworths clearing the shelves… apocalyptic,' she said.

Steve McKenzie, managing director of East Gippsland Water, said a 'boil water notice' had been issued in multiple towns.

He said the water could remain contaminated until late tomorrow - when it could finally be tested - and also urged residents in fire-ravished towns to use as little water as possible to reserve what they could for battling blazes.

Supermarkets are giving out bottled water for free and more supplies are en route.

Bega Valley Shire Council announced a boil water notice for Quaama, Cobargo, Bermagui, Beauty Point, Fairhaven, Wallaga Lake, Wallaga Lake Heights, Wallaga Lake Koori Village and Akolele on Wednesday.

'All water for drinking, food preparation, the cleaning of teeth and ice-making needs to be boiled before use,' a statement read.

Ulladulla Woolworths opened its doors on Wednesday to give locals unable to leave the chance to stock up on supplies

About 300 people turned out and lined up for at least two hours to get in the stores and make their purchases

More than 110 fires are still burning across NSW on New Years Day after conditions worsened last week. Infernos are also still ravaging Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.

At least seven people on the NSW south coast and another in Victoria died on Tuesday and Wednesday, as destructive infernos razed entire communities to the ground.

On the south coast alone, at least 176 homes were destroyed and another 50,000 left without power.

The townspeople have been told it is too late to leave - and in some cases it is even too dangerous for fire crews to enter.

As a result, residents in Ulladulla in the Shoalhaven area and nearby Narooma took the opportunity on Wednesday to stock up on essentials at the local Woolworths.

But they have been urged not to over-buy out of panic.

Amanda Findley, the Mayor of Shoalhaven City Council, reminded her townspeople the power is not predicted to be restored any time soon - meaning most homes have no access to refrigeration therefore shouldn't be looking to unnecessarily stock up on food.

She went on to say there would not be a shortage of food and asked people to buy only what they need.

Craig Scott, the store manager at the Ulladulla Woolworths, said the store was running on a recently purchased generator - but it was close to running out of fuel.

He was hoping local boat owners would share their diesel to ensure essential food and milk wouldn't spoil.

'The power's out in town, but we decided to open the store just for necessities, so people can get nappies, baby food, all that sort of stuff,' he said.

He noted about 300 people were lining up on Wednesday morning, and that most people waited about two hours to be served.

Local petrol stations have been forced to post signs letting residents know they've been run completely dry of petrol - while others simply don't have any power to operate.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday evening said power was slowly starting to be restored in towns, and thanked those who had been affected for their patience.

NSW Police confirmed a total of seven people have been killed and two are unaccounted for in the South Coast bushfires since Monday.

The deaths include dairy farmer Patrick Salway, 29, and his father Robert, 63, who died trying to save their property in Cobargo, near Bega.

Young father and volunteer firefighter Samuel McPaul, 28, was also among those confirmed dead after he was killed by a fire tornado.

A 70-year-old man was found dead outside a home at Yatte Yattah, west of Lake Conjola, on Tuesday night, while another man's body was found in a burnt vehicle on a road off the Princes Highway at Yatte Yattah Wednesday morning.

The body of a man was found in a vehicle on Wandra Road at Sussex Inlet about 11.30am Wednesday but is yet to be formally identified, while a seventh body was found outside a home Coolagolite, about 10km east of Cobargo, on Wednesday.

Beloved great-grandfather Mick Roberts, 67, from Buchan, in East Gippsland, was found dead at his home on Wednesday morning.

'Today we have the three deaths. The police have confirmed at Yatte Yattah, a body found in a vehicle there, which is near Lake Conjola,' NSW Police Force Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys told media on Wednesday afternoon.

'One at Sussex Inlet, a body in a vehicle. And ambulance officers have told us about a body that they have located as well deceased.'

'In terms of the situation down on the South Coast, we have three emergency operation centres operating locally up and down the coast that are dealing with any amount of local issues and doing their best to solve those problems for people down there.

'So we know that the damage that's been occasioned right throughout the south-east corner of New South Wales is a heavy toll. And more importantly we're seeing unfortunately the tragedy of lives lost as well,' he said on Wednesday afternoon.

'As the Premier quite rightly indicated, we need to prepare ourselves for that number to climb with information coming out this afternoon.'

And during the season of giving, we turn our attention toward a unique restaurant with a philosophy just as rare that has landed in the Twin Cities.

A group of industry folks have joined forces to roll out Provision community cafe in south Minneapolis, a nonprofit with a pay-what-you-can model.

For executive director and founder Anna Wienke, along with David Smith, chefs Kenny Beck, Manny Winston and Heather Mady, it’s a way to gather local resources, reduce food waste and overcome food insecurity by offering nutritious meals that are free and/or affordable.

“We’re a space dedicated to overcoming food insecurity, isolation and hardship in our community by serving family-style meals to patrons of all social, racial and economic classes — breaking down all barriers and creating an environment where everyone is welcome and engaged,” Wienke said. “Provision is a true neighborhood restaurant, with a space by local restaurant design giant Shea Design, where menus change by the day and seating and service is family-style.”

It takes a small army to run the operation at 2940 Harriet Ave. S. In addition to monetary donations, food contributions from local businesses also helps to cover or keep costs down. Volunteers are a big part of the front-of-the-house operation. An advisory board, from business and financial services to restaurant and food vendors, provide several areas of expertise.

How it works: The cafe is on a first-come, first-served basis. Dinners are offered with seatings at 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday. Brunch is available on Saturdays, with seatings at 10 a.m. and noon. Upon arrival, grab a seat at one of the community tables in the dining room and a family-style meal will be served. The menu changes daily and updates are posted on the Provisions Facebook page.

A recent dinner spread was made up of a salad, dirty rice, potato wedges, artisan breads and dessert. While on another night, a salad, penne with red sauce, roasted broccoli and cauliflower, garlic bread and dessert was on the roster.

At the end of the meal, a give-what-you-can model means you donate whatever amount you would like to or can, with the money going toward helping keep the nonprofit operation — a food-service model based on the One World Everybody Eats (“OWEE”) community café model used by several nonprofit organizations across the country — afloat.","Amicable divorce turns sour when it comes to money and moving out: Ask EllieQ: I’m a woman, age 36, who married a man from another country five years ago. I moved there and we bought a house together.

But we both found that we just weren’t compatible. He’s very laid-back; I’m hyperactive by comparison.

Since we had no children, we agreed to part in an amicable divorce.

I decided to go home for a visit, and scout the chances for work.

By luck, I was offered a terrific job and decided to stay. But I’d only brought one small suitcase along for the trip.

When I informed my ex that I’d like him to ship the rest of my things, and finalize splitting the proceeds from our house sale, his normally easygoing manner changed completely.

He became angry, said I’d have to do my own packing and shipping which had nothing to do with him. He added that the money wasn’t easily available.

I’m shocked at his meanness. Now I have to wait for my new job to allow early “vacation time” for me to travel overseas, retrieve my own things, and deal with this now-difficult ex about money that’s rightfully mine.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

How can I manage everything in two weeks of so-called “vacation” time?

Difficult Ex

A: Start preparations now. Reach out to your contacts where you lived for five years, and ask them to refer you to a reliable shipping company. Get informed from that company as to what proof of ownership or other papers may be required.

But before addressing the money issue with your ex, try a non-combative phone conversation with him asking if there’s anything you need to know about the house proceeds.

Then, communicate with the lawyer involved in the sale, and have him/her or another lawyer inform your ex that you require your share to re-settle back home.

Have as many conversations as possible to prepare yourself to be ready to proceed when you travel to complete the move.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Invite a local friend there to help you with the packing, especially if it’s in the presence of your ex-husband.

Q: I work in an open-concept office where my co-workers and I are respectful of each other’s sound space. Most conversations on the phone or in person are kept to reasonable decibels.

Unfortunately, we received a newcomer to our space who laughs like a hyena. I’m not exaggerating. She’ll say a name aloud, then laugh in hysterical bursts.

It’s very annoying and interferes with my concentration. What do I do/say that won’t be turned back on me as workplace harassment?

Earplugs Not Enough

A: Start with a plan of accommodation, rather than annoyance. She has an ingrained habit, you have a concentration problem.

Hers may be a nervous habit which gets exaggerated in new situation. Yours is a reaction. Neither of you are affecting or interfering with the other, on purpose.

You do have to be careful in a workplace atmosphere about how you proceed. Talk first to your supervisor who’ll likely ask a human resources representative as to the best plan (if there is an HR department).

But if left on your own, speak to this co-worker aside from others, and gently tell her that her exuberant laugh is too loud for an open-concept workplace.

Ask her to please try to tone it down. To show that you’re demonstrating goodwill, you could say that you’re willing to use earplugs when you need to concentrate more.

If she reacts badly, write a note detailing who said what, and then take it higher up.

Ellie’s tip of the day

An “amicable” divorce still requires being legally informed and aware of any financial complications.

Here's how Trump should respondWith a threat to test a “new strategic weapon” in “the near future” North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to President Donald Trump’s head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken, telegraphing to the world that he most likely will test a new long-range missile that could kill millions of Americans if it landed in a heavily populated area – but would be guaranteed to provoke a devastating U.S retaliatory attack on the North.

Trump needs to play his cards right now and base his strategy on an understanding of why North Korea continues to build and test missiles and why it refuses to abandon its nuclear weapons.

KIM JONG UN SAYS NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO TAKE 'OFFENSIVE MEASURES' TO PROTECT COUNTRY'S SECURITY

If he succeeds, the president can minimize any potential nuclear challenge coming for the communist regime and even bring Kim back to the negotiating table.

Of course, any good strategy to take on the North Korean threat must be based on facts on the ground and must be rooted in historical perspective and an understanding of what the hermit kingdom is trying to achieve and what motivates Kim’s actions.

Let’s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.

All it would take is the nuclear weapons aboard just one U.S. Navy ballistic submarine – carrying an astounding 192 nuclear warheads – to wipe out North Korea in roughly 20 minutes. Its population of 25 million people would be killed – all from just one submarine lurking below the surface in the Pacific Ocean – and Kim knows that. That’s some real “fire and fury.”

The North Korean dictator – who follows his grandfather and father in leading his nation like a communist hereditary monarch – has a clearly established goal we can all relate to: survival.

Let’s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.

Kim believes that his nuclear weapons are the ultimate insurance policy against an attack by the U.S., South Korea or any other nation aiming to overthrow his regime.

Kim knows that U.S. and United Nations forces attacked his country in the Korean War, and is well aware that American forces have waged long wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq in the years since. He doesn’t want any foreign forces seeking regime change in a second Korean War with either a conventional or a nuclear attack – and knows his nukes can act as a deterrent to prevent that.

North Korea has made huge sacrifices to build up its small but very dangerous arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles. Although the nation has an economy smaller than the state of Montana and can barely feed its own people, it has beaten the odds to join the nuclear club.

But because the North has spent huge sums of money and endured years of international economic sanctions to go nuclear, it’s not realistic to expect to Kim to simply hand over all his nuclear bombs and missiles to the U.S. anytime soon.

Demanding such a full denuclearization in return for eventual sanctions relief – something that would take years – is not a policy at all, but a recipe for disaster, simply ensuring that Kim builds more and bigger nuclear weapons.

A senior White House adviser told me that he considers North Korea “a fourth-world nation that could kill 100 million people in an hour – and that’s just with nukes, never mind all those chemical and biological weapons. North Korea is a Pandora’s box that – if you open it with military force – will spark at the very least a mini Armageddon.”

From all of this, a very clear strategy can emerge for the Trump administration if it can take a more long-term approach. The administration needs to understand that for at least the short to medium term, North Korea will be unwilling to give up its nuclear arms – the regime said as much just weeks ago.

For now, Team Trump must focus on starving the regime of any resources it can get its hands on to advance its nuclear program through the tightest sanctions possible and depriving the Kim family of any technology that could advance such a cause.

And that’s just the beginning. Washington must also ensure that Pyongyang does not sell any of its nuclear or missile technology. There is clear evidence that North Korea and Iran have traded such knowledge over the years.

America must do all it can to ensure that such transfers stop and that no other nation gains from North Korea’s nuclear advances – and prevent Pyongyang from making money off them to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs.

Such a policy of what amounts to a Cold War-style containment must be matched by a willingness to continue dialogue. The history of U.S.-North Korea relations is filled with too many ups and downs – tensions and breakthroughs that are too dangerous to continue.

We must be willing to try and remove the reasons that North Korea feels it needs nuclear weapons. That can only be done by building trust. As a start, a formal peace declaration ending the Korean War should be signed. In addition, liaison offices should be set up in each nation’s capital to ensure a crisis does not end up in a shooting war.

From there, both sides should work on small steps to remove all military threats facing the other – both nuclear and conventional. In fact, we should make the nuclear disarmament of North Korea the end goal of a long-term policy shift that could take years but lead to a more stable, less up-and-down relationship.

None of this will be easy. In fact, it would be much easier to do what every other U.S. administration has done on North Korea: confront the regime when it acts aggressively, punish it with sanctions and sound tough, but then move on to the next global crisis or challenge at home when missiles stop heading skyward. That would be a mistake.

Eventually, President Trump or a future president may reluctantly come to the painful conclusion that getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons is as impossible as trying to get Russia, China, India, Pakistan, or another member of the nuclear club to turn back the clock and give up its nukes.

Should that day come, our fallback position should be to press for an arms control agreement to limit the North Korean nuclear force to the smallest size possible in return for normalized relations.

Past U.S. leaders weren’t happy when the Soviet Union and China went nuclear – but weren’t prepared to start a nuclear war to force their denuclearization. And in all the years since, no nation has launched a nuclear attack.

In remarks Tuesday to party leaders– and shared on state media Wednesday– Kim also warned of introducing a “new strategic weapon” in the near future.

Kim’s audience also heard him accuse the United States of making “gangster-like demands,” according to Reuters.

At times smiling or slapping the podium, Kim charged the U.S. with maintaining a “hostile policy” that included holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions,

KIM JONG UN SAYS NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO TAKE ‘OFFENSIVE MEASURES’ TO PROTECT COUNTRY’S SECURITY

“The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” Kim said, using the initials for North Korea’s official name–the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, according to Reuters.

While saying he no longer felt bound to honor a moratorium, the rogue leader gave no clear indication that a resumption of such tests was impending. He also appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations with the U.S.

Kim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40 to 50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

Kim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

HARRY KAZIANIS: NORTH KOREA’S KIM HAS THIS GOAL IN MIND (NO, HE’S NOT CRAZY). HERE’S HOW TRUMP SHOULD RESPOND

Lee Sang-min, a spokesman for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said North Korea carrying out its threat to showcase a new strategic weapon would be unhelpful for diplomacy.

Kim’s comments published in state media Wednesday were made at a key, four-day meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered over disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions.

President Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word, Reuters reported.

“He likes me, I like him. We get along. He’s representing his country, I’m representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.

All items used to care for the patient should be bagged as clinical waste, including the contents of the bin, and quarantined until it is known whether the patient has tested positive for WN-CoV.

Fabric curtains and screens should also be bagged as infectious linen, while any cloths or mop heads used during cleaning should be disposed of as single use items.

If the patient spent any time in communal areas, these should be cleaned with detergent and disinfectant as soon as possible.

According to the initial guidance, GPs who suspect a patient could have the virus during a consultation should leave the room immediately, leaving the patient and their belongings inside, wash their hands and conduct the remainder of the consultation by phone. They should also contact the local health protection team.

If GPs suspect a patient has the virus during a telephone consultation they should avoid a face-to-face assessment in primary care and instead call the local secondary care infection specialist.

Spread of coronavirus

So far no known cases of WN-CoV have been reported in the UK. On Friday, England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said that the risk to the UK public remains low. However he added: 'there may well be cases in the UK at some stage'.

'We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases,' Professor Whitty said.



'We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease. We have access to some of the best infectious disease and public health experts in the world from around the UK.'

According to the BBC the number of confirmed cases of the virus in China has reached 2,827 and the number of deaths has risen to 81. At least 20 Chinese cities have been placed on lockdown in an attempt to prevent the virus spreading.

Sienna Santer is a second-year Harvard student and a popular YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers.

She shares videos on topics like how she got into the prestigious university and what a day in her life is like.

Santer's influencer career started with friends and family members asking her how she got accepted into Harvard. After a video of her Harvard dorm-room tour got 4.8 million views, Santer treats her YouTube channel and Instagram page like a part-time job.

""I had so many people asking how I got in and if I could give them advice,"" she told Business Insider. ""Instead of writing back and forth, I decided to put everything into a video and send that to them.""

Now she earns money from ads in her videos placed by Google and by promoting brands like Audible and the vitamin company Care/of on her channel.

In 2019, she earned just over $44,000 through Google's AdSense program, which places ads in her YouTube videos, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider. (She said she'd have to pay about 25% of that in taxes.)

How YouTube creators like Santer earn money online

Creators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible for YouTube's Partner Program, through which they can earn money off their channels by placing ads in videos.

Santer averages about $3,000 a month from AdSense, she said.

""My channel has helped me deal with things a lot earlier than some of my friends and helped me a lot with money-management skills,"" she said. ""I have checks for AdSense coming in the mail that I have put aside for taxes, retirement, savings.""

How much an influencer earns from Google's AdSense program on a YouTube video depends on a number of factors, from the place in the video where viewers normally drop off to the type of advertisers the video gets. Some top creators have ad-placement strategies for earning the most money possible. Generally, how much money is earned varies based on a video's watch time, length, and viewer demographic.

Some videos that contain swearing or copyrighted music can be flagged by YouTube and demonetized, earning hardly any money for the creator (or none at all).

Santer previously told Business Insider that she usually adds two to three ads to a video that is over 10 minutes long and follows certain techniques to optimize her video's performance.

Santer is part of a rising trend of YouTubers that are gaining audiences by sharing their college experiences — especially their move-in videos, which can rack up millions of views (and in Santer's case, thousands of dollars). Margot Lee, a Syracuse student with 425,000 YouTube subscribers, teaches an informal pop-up class on becoming a professional influencer to her classmates (and shared her slides with Business Insider).

One year later, he has 300,000 subscribers and earned six figures just from ads placed on his videos by Google.

Jikh spoke to Business Insider about deciding to start a YouTube channel, how he maximizes his earnings, and how much he earned per month in 2019.

Personal finance YouTuber Andrei Jikh grew up in a family of circus performers from Russia, and he moved to the US at age 9 when his dad got a job with Cirque du Soleil.

Jikh fell in love with magic and filming home videos. Ten years later, he was hired by a startup to teach magic online.

But when his parents acquired ""crazy debt,"" Jikh became obsessed with personal finance.

""We were immigrants when we came here,"" he told Business Insider. ""We didn't really know how to manage our money, credit cards, so my parents got into crazy debt. It had a big effect on me when I was younger. At 19, I tried to teach myself, interviewing everyone I worked with to learn what they do.""

In late 2018, he quit his job, and with the roughly $200,000 he had in savings, started making personal finance videos for YouTube.

A year later, he has 300,000 subscribers and earned more than $100,000 in 2019 from ads that run in his videos — far more than the $60,000 he made at his peak year as an online magician.

""I never wanted to be in the spotlight,"" he told Business Insider. ""But if that's not your goal, then magic becomes extremely limited, and there's very few ways for you to earn money in that industry.""

Jikh's monthly revenue quickly increased

In just a few months, Jikh was starting to make real money.

Creators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible to have their videos monetized with ads by joining YouTube's Partner Program. How much they earn depends on a number of factors, like a video's watch time, length, video type, and viewer demographics. Some top creators have ad-placement strategies to maximize their earnings.

Here's his monthly AdSense breakdown for 2019:

Jikh said he spent around $10,000 to build a studio and buy camera equipment and spends five to six hours per week doing research for his videos, three to four hours filming, and 10 to 18 hours on editing. He doesn't have a talent agent or manager, he said.

Jikh said he learned to make more money by including mid-roll ads, which can run in videos lasting over 10 minutes. They can be skippable or non-skippable, and creators can place them manually or have them automatically placed by YouTube.

""You can strategically place ads wherever you want,"" he said. ""If you in the middle of talking about something important, place an ad before you say what it is. I try to place an ad every 3 to 4 minutes, just finding a natural break in the video to place it.""

He said he also earns money online through Patreon, Amazon links, affiliate marketing, and hopes to add sponsored content to the mix in 2020.

For many, the domestic terror incident that injured more than a dozen Jews in the Hasidic enclave of Monsey, New York, provided a convenient new weapon with which to strike at their political enemies.

This attack was a chameleon. It managed to represent everything and anything to the eye of the beholder. The attack, perpetrated by black men, was the fault of white supremacist fans of the president.

It was the fault of Jews for having the gall to live in blue states, for voting for Democrats.

Very sad indeed. Maybe stop voting overwhelmingly for Democrats and you might get the leadership that will protect you. Jews vote 3-1 for Dems, I don’t get it...they don’t care about you... — Covfefe2020-text Trump to 88022 (@Covfefe2020Eas) December 30, 2019

And it was Jews' faults for daring to build homes.

Goes on bla bla pic.twitter.com/6lcweVdL2R — Baruch Sandhaus (@BaruchSandhaus) December 29, 2019

The attacks happening against Jews daily (and sometimes, multiple times a day) are not a game, and yet, they are being treated as such by people more interested in scoring political points than putting an end to the violence.

Those playing these political games with Jewish lives may not be storming synagogues, supermarkets, or homes with machetes or guns, but they are still a major part of the problem leading to anti-Semitic violence and incitement.

Those who reflexively blame President Trump for any and all attacks, no matter how unrelated his administration, actions, or rhetoric are, have made a conscious choice: They would rather play politics than put an end to the violence. And worse, it seems they would like it to continue, in order to have more ammunition against the White House leading up to the 2020 election.

Just as dangerous are those on the Right who are using the occasion to lecture Jews on how they should be voting, that they should be arming themselves and fortifying their houses of worship, and where they should be living. The problem of anti-Semitism isn’t because Jews vote one way or another. (This is a complicated issue when you break down voting histories between Orthodox and secular Jews, but that is a conversation for another time.)

Solving anti-Semitism doesn’t involve making our supermarkets, schools, synagogues, and more into fortresses. That’s not how any of us want to live. Unfortunately, we’ve begun to, and yet the violence continues and is becoming more serious by the day. Most of the attacks in New York have been in the streets, and they’ve taken place against men, the elderly, and even women with their children, in broad daylight and in full view of the public.

Advocating for Jews taking advantage of the protections of the Second Amendment is a moot point for many panicked Jews living in areas where obtaining a gun permit is an uphill climb and a conceal carry permit an absolute impossibility. We can recognize that Jews are safer while armed and advocate for less restrictive gun laws while still acknowledging that guns aren’t a magic bullet to solve this crisis, either. In the long term, there is a battle to be fought for expanded access to guns, but in the short term, lectures about firearms are paternalistic and can be deeply frustrating for panicked people unable to avail themselves of the option.

That this is the case in New York and New Jersey isn’t the fault of the Orthodox Jews living there. Instead of being condescended to about needing to move, allies would be far more appreciated and be doing far more good, continuing to advocate for less restrictive gun laws in these jurisdictions instead of expecting a small community under siege to flee the homes of their parents and grandparents.

There are societal issues that are much more complex and deeper at play — the rot is far more complicated than mere politics and Trump. As long as the violence striking the Jewish community is treated as a political cudgel, it will continue unabated.

Weed dispensaries across the state opened their doors before sunrise Wednesday, welcoming long lines of customers — some who had been waiting since 4 a.m.

""Cheers to lighting up the start of 2020!"" one dispensary, Sunnyside, wrote on its Facebook page.

Under Illinois law, anyone over 21 with a valid state ID or driver's license can purchase recreational marijuana from licensed retailers.

Jackie Ryan, right, of Forest Park, Ill., becomes the first person in Illinois to purchase recreational marijuana as she purchases marijuana products from employee Brea Mooney left, at Sunnyside dispensary Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2020, in Chicago. More

Residents may legally possess up to 30 grams of cannabis flower, five grams of concentrate and 500 milligrams of THC in products such as edibles. Non-Illinois residents in the state may possess up to only half as much as residents.

The law also includes a ""social equity"" plan to improve diversity in the industry by giving a leg up to minority entrepreneurs disproportionately impacted by poverty and the war on drugs. The law expunges certain drug-based criminal records and establishes a fund to provide financial resources for business start-ups, among other provisions.

Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker rang in 2020 by granting more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions Tuesday.

""The war on cannabis has destroyed families. It has filled jails and prisons with nonviolent offenders. It has disproportionately affected black and brown communities,"" Pritzker said at a press conference on Chicago's South Side.

""Every state that has legalized cannabis has seen high demand and long lines in its earliest weeks, and to be sure, our state will, too. But unlike other states, in Illinois, we purposely built a system where the market has room to grow, so that entrepreneurs, including especially those from the communities devastated by the war on drugs, will have real opportunities in this industry.""

Illinois weed sales: Some say only white men are set to profit

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx looks on as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker speaks during a press conference in Chicago after Foxx filed motions to vacate more than 1,000 low-level cannabis convictions, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2019. More

Illinois is the 11th state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana. Thirty-three states allow the sale of marijuana for medical use, which Illinois legalized in 2013.

Some restrictions still apply, however. Landowners can ban cannabis use, and employers can prohibit employees from having THC in their systems.

It's illegal to drive while impaired and to possess marijuana on federal land and federally funded facilities, including some hospitals, public housing and more. Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level and cannot be taken across state lines – by any form of transportation.

The marijuana industry in Illinois could eventually bring in $1.69 billion to $2.58 billion in annual revenue, according to a study by Colorado consulting firm Freedman and Koski. That would mean an additional $440 million to $676 million in annual tax revenue statewide, the study said.

Chicago, which is facing a more than $800 million budget deficit, expects to bring in $3.5 million in revenue from marijuana taxes next year.

A long line of people brave the cold as they wait to be the first in Illinois to purchase recreational marijuana at Sunnyside dispensary Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2020, in Chicago. More

Illinois started the new year on a high note Wednesday, becoming the latest US state to legalize recreational marijuana as the governor pardoned thousands for past low-level cannabis convictions.

The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act will allow residents 21 and older to legally purchase marijuana and will expunge thousands of individuals' criminal convictions throughout the state.

""We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core,"" Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in a statement.

On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.

According to the statement, the new law will use 25 percent of the state's cannabis revenue to help ""the communities hit hardest"" by the earlier crackdown on marijuana.

""Today we took another step toward justice, as we continue to address the failed war on drugs and the disproportionate impact it had on communities of color,"" Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said in the statement.

Illinois residents age 21 and older will now be allowed to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC -- the main active ingredient of cannabis -- contained in a cannabis-infused product.

Non-residents are allowed to carry 15 grams of cannabis under the bill, which will also create a licensed growing and dispensary system.

Illinois is the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, along with Washington, DC. Thirty-four states and the federal capital permit medical cannabis treatment.

But the US Drug Enforcement Administration still considers marijuana a dangerous substance alongside LSD and heroin.

A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control published in August found that states that legalize recreational marijuana see a reduction of at least 20 percent in fatalities linked to opioid overdoses.

Marijuana legalization has also been shown to improve a state's economic activity, creating jobs and bringing in new tax revenue.","""The war on cannabis has destroyed families.""Every state that has legalized cannabis has seen high demand and long lines in its earliest weeks, and to be sure, our state will, too.But unlike other states, in Illinois, we purposely built a system where the market has room to grow, so that entrepreneurs, including especially those from the communities devastated by the war on drugs, will have real opportunities in this industry.""Some restrictions still apply, however.Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level and cannot be taken across state lines – by any form of transportation.","On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.""Today we took another step toward justice, as we continue to address the failed war on drugs and the disproportionate impact it had on communities of color,"" Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said in the statement.Illinois residents age 21 and older will now be allowed to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC -- the main active ingredient of cannabis -- contained in a cannabis-infused product.A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control published in August found that states that legalize recreational marijuana see a reduction of at least 20 percent in fatalities linked to opioid overdoses.Marijuana legalization has also been shown to improve a state's economic activity, creating jobs and bringing in new tax revenue.",,

The incoming year is no different. As the curtain dropped on 2019 last Tuesday, to open up to 2020, the clamour across board is for security of people and properties, good governance, stable economy, vibrant health sector, viable education sector without incessant strike actions and basic amenities- good roads, stable power, adequate housing and potable water. THISDAY sampled the opinion of Nigerians across board and here are the excerpts:

Ezegbogu Malachi, Medical Doctor My expectations for Nigeria this 2020 are for a stronger and a more united country, actualisation of the dreams of our founding fathers, strong and functional government institutions, better implementation of our annual budget and a better economy. Also, I expect a stronger respect for human rights and freedom of the press. More opportunities for our teeming youth and development of indigenous talents. Mr Osanyintola Oladayo, Oil Contractor My expectations in 2020 are really high but I want to believe it’s impossible. Firstly, I will say the government must be able to provide some basic social amenities that can help improve the livelihood of all inhabitants of this country. Secondly, they must improve on job creation in various sectors of the economy. This has a long way to go in improving the economy and this would also encourage Nigerians to study because they know there is a reward for hard work. In addition, refining our crude oil here in our country will be of a better advantage and would boost the economy better, especially when the refineries function well and are properly managed. In conclusion, my expectations for Nigeria are beyond those mentioned and I know with God and good leadership, we should get positive results in no time. Mr. Adetola Adeleke; CEO Azacom Global My expectations for the year 2020 are a remarkable improvement in infrastructure, projects across the country to enhance true dividends of democracy. This is not limited to power, agriculture, education, rural development, urban renewal, power generation and transmission, prompt payment of workers salaries and allowances etcetera. Engr. Jim Oriahi, MNSE Nigeria is a great country and my expectations for 2020 are as follows: I want a Nigeria that is more focused on human development because the higher the Human Development Index (HDI), the more prosperous the country becomes. Unlike the GDP or GNP, which give income and productivity only, HDI is a vehicle for which income is turned into development; in the education or health sectors for instance. For a country to develop, the literacy level, education, and health sectors should be a priority to the government. Government must ensure that citizens have access to good health care, child mortality/mobidity rates at birth are of concerns, with access to quality education and a platform to incorporate learned knowledge to real-life situations. I look forward to a Nigeria where Income Per Capita is put in check to ensure there is a balance in labour/payments received per annum. High per capita income signifies high economic and financial security for the Nigerian populace. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also used to determine the per capita value. Industrialisation plays a major part in a country’s development. For a country to grow, the rate of industrialisation and employment must be high, thus creating some level of job security for her citizens is very important. I want Nigeria to be such a nation with higher export than imports leading to more profits from the international trade which will ensure that there is economic growth. A Nigeria with political stability. Having stable political environment, low or no corruption, and high level of respect to the country’s laws. Good governance ensures that the level of corruption is low, transparency in the various activities of the government, and employment is based on merit. A Nigeria with good standard of living and with respect for all classes of her citizens. A Nigeria where the government and the masses uphold her peace and unity, and a country with freedom for all. God bless Nigeria. Prince Ozioma Ohia, Real Estate Contractor According to the nobel laureate Professor Chinua Achebe, ‘Nigeria’s struggles as a nation has been of leadership problems and these are manifested in policy formulation and decision making and how these policies are implemented- most of which are not people friendly and proposed policies are anathema to the polity. Some are even enacted oblivious of the electorate and the citizens. The question remains; Cui Bono? The current administration should focus on what every Nigerian yearns for. The development of the human potential. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals of vision 2020, is centered on ‘Human Capital Development’. Great emphasis and energy should be directed towards this area. Thank God for the policy of the Central Bank towards farmers, a step in the right direction. It should not be a political goal scoring point. Professor Claudius Ake asserts that ‘Mans Basic need is Food, Clothing and Shelter’. We should see more partnership between the federal government and the higher institutes of learning especially in the agro sector. There is a positive expectation from the citizenry in the coming year concerning power. The challenges of power generation should be overcome.

Vivian Oyinatumba, Student

I pray 2020 graces me with better opportunities, growth and, I hope Nigeria becomes a more conducive environment. The year 2019 did not really favour me; the year was a rollercoaster of different events rocking the country. This is why I pray for a better 2020, and that the government at all levels will do more for the masses.

Endurance Evulukwu; CEO Endykollections

My hope and expectations for the new year is to make Endykollections a fashion household name in Nigeria, and for every Nigerian woman to be an endykollectionswoman. I want to expand my business, so as to create job opportunities for the Nigerian youth. Then I want Nigeria to get better, and for every Nigerian to be passionate about contributing to nation building. And most importantly, I want to move closer to God

Timi Timz, Radio Host, PR and Comms Consultant and Entrepreneur

I know 2020 is going to be an amazing year for myself and others. It will be full of success stories, love, laughter, travels, lovely experiences and beautiful memories. Life is to be lived!

Kemi Ogunleye, Events Planner

I pray 2020 would be an amazing year for me; I strongly believe it would be filled with success for me and my friends. I also pray for anyone confused about life and their career to receive clarity in Jesus name. Stay happy always!

Henrietta Okoye; Youth Corp Member

I hope and expect to have a good job come 2020, build up my own business, travel to more than 20 countries, have a family of my own, if God permits. I pray Nigeria becomes a better country devoid of the present economic issues we’re currently battling.

Isi Stella Aigbomian, Midwife My expectations for 2020 as touching healthcare is basically an improvement on the resources in the health sector, referring to both maternal and human. In terms of material resources, I am optimistic that attention of the government and all other health related policy makers will come to the conclusion of equipping our health facilities ranging from primary health care to tertiary health facilities with necessary and basic equipment which assure quality assurance of care, both for diagnostic and patient treatment. In addition, policies that strengthen environmental sanitation and pollution control be put in place for the benefit of all. I also urge the government to prioritise healthcare of the citizens of Nigerians knowing that health is wealth. Rimamskep Ifusumu, Medical Doctor I expect a robust health institution with cancer centres in the six geopolitical regions fully equipped with modern Radioactive machines, and trauma centres built in three geopolitical regions, more funds for residency training to meet up the teaming or curb population of young doctors traveling abroad and meet up with the country’s population demand. I urge the government to increase budgetary allocation to achieve the above. Alabi Tolulope, Fashion Designer To the best of my knowledge, I believe the government needs our taxes to construct better roads in our country, and better roads will reduce the time we spend in traffic daily hence leading to greater and higher productivity on each day’s job/activities. The efficiency from jobs well done will improve the economic system. It will also divert our focus to accomplishing higher goals or trying out new inventions. People and companies evading taxes are doing the masses more harm than good, citizens who don’t pay their taxes have no right to complain about bad roads and other social amenities. So in year 2020 I implore people to pay their taxes promptly and correctly. One of the major problems with the governance of Nigeria is that the government is far from the masses. People are hungry, homeless, jobless and depressed, but the people in power seem not to know the extent to which some of their policies are affecting the masses. They should organise town-hall meetings to know what the masses are going through, this will bring governance closer to the smallest groups. Hon. Ishola Ibrahim, Politician Last year was really a roller coaster journey. After a general assessment of activities and event in 2019, it gives me great joy and expectations to look forward to 2020 as it will consolidate on achievements of 2019. I look forward to a 2020 of perfection. A year of joy creation and youths empowerment using available resources at our disposal. Investing in capacity building to make our youths discover their potentials, so as to become entrepreneurs, and in turn reduce unemployment and Al’s positive increase the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Osayuwame Ebuehi, Physiotherapist We hope that 2020 will be a good year having signed the budget early for private sector to chip in more businesses to develop the economy. And as regards the roads and electricity, with the constant and consistent payment of income tax, PAYE and VAT, and Nigerian government investing on it, Nigeria will make a better place. As regards the health, I would implore the government to provide more beds for hospitals, adequate facilities and good working Individuals. On my field, I need machines to process herbal roots and leafs to make it edible and very much reliable for consumption. Olatunji Adeleke, Professional Photographer In 2020, I expect the government to focus on building a friendly economy that attracts investors and embark on growing SME businesses as it will be a good bedrock for nation building. I also urge for the government as we approach 2020, they should stop living a lie and embark on serious and constructive poverty alleviation programmes for over 90 per cent of poverty stricken. I urge the government to be prudent in their spending, to be more calculative and wise. Adeola Alabi, Accountant I wish a good economy that will give entrepreneurs a fastanstic platform to operate, good road networks and stable electricity, as well as plan towards improving the standard of living of Nigerians by creating job opportunities for the youths. Adelaja Osisowo, Administrator, Broadcast Media Of course I expect better reform in policy making that would improve the economy in 2020. And repairs of our major roads both at the federal and state level including local levels. The government should be more proactive rather than reactive to things in 2020. Joshua Marcus Usoro, Singer and Dancer I expect a better and more stable economy and more opportunities for youths to grow and for health, I believe the Nigerian government should enforce health insurance and better equipment in hospitals for all Nigerians, it will save a lot of lives.","2019 not a successful year for Nigerians – AtikuTags: featured

Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described 2020 as symbolic in many ways, saying it’s time to work for a better future for Nigerians.

In a new year message released in Abuja on Tuesday, Atiku noted that the year heralds a brand new decade required Nigerians to stay together more than ever before.

He charged the leadership and the led to take on, head front, the common enemy of insecurity that challenged the citizenry in their everyday life.

The statement said, “I do not share the sentiments when some people claim that the outgone 2019 was a successful year for Nigerians. Such sentiments are reductionist and do the harm of making us have a false sense of victory.

“The bitter truth is that Nigeria is still in the throes of economic instability, with more people losing jobs and the attendant outcome of more children being out of school and more families having hard time in accessing basic needs of life.

“In this New Year, however, I will rather ask that Nigerians stand together with renewed vigour and determination to battle the hydra-headed demon of insecurity that has plagued us in the past decade.

“We must challenge the inadequacies that made us become the global headquarters of extreme poverty; much as we must work hard and fast enough to eliminate the scourge of out-of-school children in the country. These are the challenges that this new decade has thrown at us and we cannot afford to slumber and submit to defeat”.

Atiku observed that the problems of extreme poverty and scant investments in education played huge roles in fueling the problems of violent extremism that characterised the past decade.

He warned that the country cannot win the fight against terrorism without reducing or eliminating poverty and illiteracy.

Continuing, Atiku said, “The reality of this new decade requires of us to recalibrate our approaches and to pursue some tough choices. If failure is not an option, then we must let go of our egos and conveniences.

“In this new decade, we must start to do things differently if we are honest about our desire for a better and prosperous future. There must be a deliberate effort to improve the material wellbeing of the people, by lifting millions of Nigerians out of the extreme poverty belt at a start, and to prosperity. Government must rethink many of its policies that are sinking more people into the abyss of extreme poverty.

“It is incumbent on government at all levels to pursue policies that will provide decent housing to the mass majority; put food on the table; provide healthcare and education. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different outcome. It is therefore high time we caused a rejig of economic policies that will promote an expansion of the economy and create job opportunities aplenty.

“At the individual level, this moment calls for more empathy and sacrifice. The New Year and a new decade come with the opportunity to make better impressions in our lives and in the lives of people around us.

“I wish to restate that our collective call for rule of law and our history about the struggle for democratic rule did not envisage a situation where judicial pronouncements would be worthless than the paper upon which they are rendered.

“It is a bad advertisement for the country and its democracy if declarations made by the courts are not respected without the executive arm of government agreeing to same.

“Any democracy is not worth the appellation if the principle of separation of powers is not ingrained in it. In the new year, government should not pretend to be democratic, but rather act according to the fundamentals of a democracy.

“Above all, I expect that in the New Year, there will be a better observance of rule of law and greater respect for citizens’ democratic rights.

“While we anticipate a change of attitude across board in the new year and new decade, I wish every Nigerian a happy and prosperous 2020”.","Expectations, Aspirations and Goals for 2020Ayodeji Ake, Sunday Ehigiator and Chiamaka Ozulumba, who sampled the opinion of some Nigerians, write that aside their personal goals, their expectations and aspirations for 2020 are for government to provide infrastructural development, basic amenities, as well as create better business environment for all to thrive in Year in, year out, the needs of Nigerians practically remain the same; provision of basic amenities by their elected officials, infrastructural development across board, favourable business environment and adequate security, amongst others.Engr.Unlike the GDP or GNP, which give income and productivity only, HDI is a vehicle for which income is turned into development; in the education or health sectors for instance.People are hungry, homeless, jobless and depressed, but the people in power seem not to know the extent to which some of their policies are affecting the masses.They should organise town-hall meetings to know what the masses are going through, this will bring governance closer to the smallest groups.","He warned that the country cannot win the fight against terrorism without reducing or eliminating poverty and illiteracy.If failure is not an option, then we must let go of our egos and conveniences.“At the individual level, this moment calls for more empathy and sacrifice.In the new year, government should not pretend to be democratic, but rather act according to the fundamentals of a democracy.“While we anticipate a change of attitude across board in the new year and new decade, I wish every Nigerian a happy and prosperous 2020”.", #;# , )#1#

Boot, one of Trump’s most outspoken critics on the right, recalls that although he was critical of President Barack Obama’s Iran policy in 2015, it was better than Trump’s.

Obama’s deal with Iran, Boot writes, “did nothing to curb Iran’s regional power play and may have even fueled it by lifting economic sanctions — which is why I and others opposed it at the time. But it did at least stop Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. President Trump blundered by exiting the nuclear deal in 2018 and imposing economic sanctions on Iran in 2019, even though it was complying with the agreement.”

The airstrikes in Iran and Syria over the weekend were in response to a missile attack on a military compound near Kirkuk, Iraq on Friday that left a contractor dead. And the airstrikes, Boot notes, “killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah.”

“The United States has only two ways out of this escalating crisis: fight or negotiate,” Boot emphasizes. “A war with Iran, as I have previously argued, could be the mother of all quagmires; it could easily spin out of control with tit-for-tat responses of the kind we have seen in recent days. Better to negotiate. That would mean trying to rebuild a tougher nuclear deal in return for the lifting of U.S. sanctions.”







Boot concludes his column by lamenting that things will only get worse for the U.S. in the Middle East if Trump fails to come up with a coherent Iran policy.

“Trump shows little interest in either seriously negotiating or fighting,” Boot laments. “He has waged economic warfare on Iran while doing nothing to curb its regional aggression; indeed, by withdrawing U.S. troops from part of northern Syria, he has allowed an extension of Iranian influence. So, we are left with the worst of all possible worlds: Iran is once again waging a low-intensity conflict, and America once again has no effective response.”","Iraq embassy protests: US troops fire tear gas at Iran-backed demonstratorsUS troops on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of pro-Iranian militia members who hurled rocks at the US Embassy as a tense standoff in Baghdad entered its second day.

Scores of demonstrators camped outside the embassy overnight after they stormed the heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, chanting “Death to America,” lighting fires at security posts, spraying graffiti on walls and trying to bust through sealed entrances.

US Marines fired tear gas into the crowds that returned on Wednesday and set fire to the roof of a reception area.

At one point, Iraqi soldiers and counterterrorism forces positioned themselves between the militia members and the compound.

The unrest erupted after US jet fighters attacked five bases in Iraq and Syria belonging to the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah over the weekend, killing 25 fighters and wounding dozens more.

The US strike was in retaliation for a rocket attack on an Iraq base by the group that killed an American contractor and wounded four US service members.

President Trump was asked about the escalating situation in Iraq and whether the US was planning on going to war with Iran.

“I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn’t last very long. Do I want to? No. I want to have peace. I like peace. And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don’t see that happening. No, I don’t think Iran would want that to happen. It would go very quickly,” Trump told reporters before a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mainly Shiite-aligned militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, called on its supporters to move away from the compound after the Iraqi government said their “message has been heard.”

Mohammed Mohieh, a spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, said the group’s members would not budge until the US ambassador is removed and US troops leave Iraq.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US would deploy about 750 troops to the Middle East in response to the storming of the embassy.

“This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,” Esper said in a statement. “The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world.”","And the airstrikes, Boot notes, “killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah.”

Donald Trump has claimed he “likes” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.

The US president responded to the supreme leader’s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce a “new strategic weapon” – accusing the Trump administration of having “gangster-like demands”.

Speaking told reporters at his new year's eve party at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump said: “He likes me, I like him, we get along ... he’s representing his country, I’m representing my country, we have to do what we have to do.

“But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation ... That was done in Singapore, and I think he’s a man of his word, so we’re going to find out.”

Mr Trump also said he would be happy to have a trial in the US Senate following his impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. “I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter.”

“As far as I’m concerned I’d be very happy with a trial because we did nothing wrong. The impeachment – I call it impeachment light,” he added, predicting any Senate trial would “go very easy”.

The president suggested he would win the 2020 election comfortably if the media treated him differently. “If you’re honourable I’m going to win the election by a lot. If you’re not honourable I’m just going to win the election by a little. So I’d rather have you be honourable.”

Mr Trump also addressed the attack on the US embassy in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, having earlier said he held Iran responsible.

“I think he’s a man of his word,” Trump says of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pic.twitter.com/bYQLXeBYPA — QuickTake by Bloomberg (@QuickTake) January 1, 2020

Washington drafted in Apache attack helicopters and scores of US Marines to reinforce the embassy compound after storming of the site by Iraqi militia members and their supporters.

“We had some great warriors come in,” said Mr Trump. “This will not be a Benghazi … this will never, ever be a Benghazi,” he added, referring to the deadly attack on a US diplomatic compound in Libya in 2012.

The president has deployed 750 US soldiers to the Middle East, as about 3,000 more are prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.

Mr Trump also said the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising. He was vague about what the plan would entail, but suggested “certain flavours” in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market “for a period of time”.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration would ban the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes.

Young left-handed opener Manjot Kalra, who scored a hundred in the final of the last edition of U-19 World Cup, has been suspended by outgoing DDCA Ombudsman for one year from playing Ranji Trophy, for an alleged age-fraud during his U-16 and U-19 days. However for the same offence, Delhi senior team vice-captain Nitish Rana has been let off for the time being with more documents being sought to prove that he fudged his age at the junior level. Another U-19 star Shivam Mavi's case has been referred to the BCCI since he now represents Uttar Pradesh in senior cricket.

The outgoing Ombudsman Justice (Retired) Badr Durrez Ahmed passed an order (a copy of which is with PTI) on his final day, preventing Kalra from playing age-group cricket for two years but more importantly denying him a chance to play Ranji Trophy for this season. Kalra, whose age as per BCCI records is 20 years 351 days, last week played for Delhi U-23 against Bengal and scored 80. He was in line to replace senior opener Shikhar Dhawan in the Ranji squad but as it now stands, he will not play any further.

When asked a senior DDCA official, he expressed his helplessness. ""I find it surprising that Manjot Kalra has been punished for the same offence that Nitish Rana is also allegedly guilty of. We couldn't pick Manjot as it was Ombudsman's order. He passed it at 11:30 pm at night, a day before he relinquished office. Now that's a bit bizarre,"" DDCA general secretary Vinod Tihara told PTI.

In case of Rana, former Ombudsman has asked DDCA to enquire from his school DAV Centenary, Narela and seek specific birth-certificate related documents and place before next hearing. But question remains when the old Ombudsman is not there, does it mean new appointee Justice Deepak Verma will conduct fresh enquiry? What everyone is failing to understand is how Kalra can be prevented from playing senior level cricket for age-fraud?

""He has been prevented from playing club matches also. Now his parents will have to appeal for a change of order in front of new Ombudsman. Till then DDCA can't pick him for Ranji Trophy. We are helpless,"" Tihara said. For the Punjab game in Mohali, selectors have picked right-handed middle-order batsman Vaibhav Kandpal and seam bowling all-rounder Siddhant Sharma in the squad of 15 in place of Shikhar Dhawan and Ishant Sharma.

Fun, smart, scary and with just the right whiff of ham … Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have served up a diabolic luxury

Do you want to have some FUN this Christmastide?

Do you like RIPPING YARNS? Do you think there’s no greater pleasure than a brilliant story brilliantly told?

You do? Well, have I got good news for you. Which is: BBC One’s new series Dracula is a pure and joyous BELTER. It’s in three parts of 90 glorious minutes each, adapted by Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss. And it is basically Sherlock but about Dracula. And peak Sherlock at that: seeking always to entertain the audience, revitalising the story while revelling in its absurdity, clever without being clever-clever, and strewn with comic and dramatic flourishes that give you the feeling that this is not just a treat but a tribute – to the author, to the season, to you as an intelligent viewer.

It’s a proper job, is what I’m saying. And that means proper scares. No spoilers, but the one in the [redacted] when the [redacted] suddenly [redacted] had me clinging to the ceiling. I advise parental supervision at all times. My dad was annoyed at having to come over, but needs must when the devil calls and starts emanating from your screen.

Everything you need is here. A dark, unmappable, labyrinthine castle. Gnarled hands resting on balcony ledges, their unseen owner lurking in shadowy recesses. Terrified locals. Bats. Babies crying. Primal fears inescapably roused.

The story unfolds within two timeframes, the Now and the Then. In the Now, where we begin, a strangely deformed man is being interviewed in a nunnery by Sister Agatha (Dolly Wells) who – and I’m calling it now – is quite the best nun of all time, and not just because she has no time at all for God. “Like many women my age I am trapped in a loveless marriage, maintaining appearances for the sake of a roof over my head,” she says briskly. She is investigating the man’s tale of escape from someone he calls Count Dracula. The man’s name is Jonathan Harker and he is played by John Heffernan with the same utter conviction brought to the story by the rest of the cast via a script and direction that are all refreshingly devoid of any shred of cynicism. You may point, as apparent disproof of my assertion, to Sister Agatha’s response to Harker’s failure to realise the significance of an SOS message written in English in the heart of eastern Europe: “You are an English man,” she explains. “A combination of presumptions beyond compare.” But you would be wrong. She is simply a truth-teller, unfettered by convention. This is quite different. Also, top nunning. I will brook no riposte.

Harker was brought by a fisherman to the nunnery, having been found washed up on the banks of a nearby river muttering about forces of evil. He looks a half-formed thing – bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds’ irradiated Deadpool – as well, it turns out, he might.

Related: Claes Bang on playing a sexy Dracula: 'He's insatiable – and not just for blood!'

Harker is a lawyer who was sent to talk a mysterious client through some legal issues at his castle. That’s the Then. The client is an unsettling, old, old man with a – Transylvanian, is it? – accent who says exactly the things you want an old, old man with a Transylvanian accent and an unmappable castle to say. Things such as “I don’t drink … wine”, and “The people around here have no flavour”. “Perhaps you mean ‘character’?” suggests Harker gently. “Perhaps,” replies the old, old man. When asked if there is anyone else living in the place, he replies “No. There’s no one … living here.” It is around this point that you find your bum wriggling its way more firmly into the sofa.

The client takes a shine to him, and so Harker must stay. His health fails, he gets weaker by the day – but the years fall away from Dracula until he stands revealed as Danish actor Claes Bang, embodying exactly the wolfish charm and diabolic spirit you love to see in a prince … wait, what am I saying?! The prince of darkness.

It’s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with just the faintest hint of ham gothic yarns need; a homage to all the great Counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing. And again, like the best of Gatiss and Moffat’s Sherlocks, with the searching intelligence that promises to flesh out the foundational story. Enjoy sinking your teeth into it all.","As the BBC's Dracula terrifies millions of viewers, CHRISTOPHER STEVENS gives a five-star thumbs-upDracula

Pictured: Claes Bang as Dracula

On the first day of Veganuary, my TV gave to me, twelve nuns a-bleeding, eleven bats a-feeding, ten ghouls a-shrieking, nine corpses twitching, eight demons drooling, seven wolves a-howling, six crosses burning, five fin-ger-nails...

Four goblets of blood, three dead rats, two stakes through the heart and a vampire baby in a bad mood.

Good luck if you were trying to give up meat for the month.

Dracula (BBC1) was dripping with more gore than a raw hamburger marinaded in pig's blood and garnished with an eyeball.

And that was before the Lord of the Undead decapitated Mother Superior Joanna Scanlan, sending a fountain of vermilion like a geyser across the altar of the convent chapel.

This was a Dracula to delight horror movie fans of all stripes. From the bone-chilling menace of Max Schreck in the silent classic Nosferatu almost 100 years ago, to the sheer camp silliness of Hammer horror's bosomy virgins, it paid homage to them all.

Writers Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat have done this before, reinventing a Victorian masterpiece for a 21st century television audience, with Sherlock.

By taking all the elements they love most from all their favourite versions, the duo salute the past while creating an entirely original vision.

Perhaps seeking to stir up publicity, Gatiss and Moffat had announced that this would be a homoerotic Dracula. It wasn't in the first episode: Exuberantly camp, certainly, but not noticeably gay.

Dracula was dripping with more gore than a raw hamburger marinaded in pig's blood and garnished with an eyeball, writes Christopher Stevens (Pictured: Bang and Dolly Wells as Sister Agatha)

In fact, the script was lovingly sucking up lines from all kinds of treasured movies, feeding off the classics. When naive lawyer Jonathan Harker (John Heffernan) finally realised that his host at a remote Transylvanian castle meant to murder him, he gasped: 'You're a monster!'

'And you're a lawyer,' retorted the Count (Claes Bang). 'Nobody's perfect.'

Any film buff knows that gag is the punchline from Some Like It Hot, which is nobody's idea of a vampire movie.

When a nun armed with a crucifix and a wooden stake tried to drive the dark lord away from the cloister gates, she reminded him he could not withstand the radiance of her Christian goodness.

'Goodness has got nothing to do with it,' smirked Dracula, quoting Mae West.

Bang, one of Denmark's most outstanding actors, was relishing every mouthful of his dialogue.

He began the 90-minute episode, the first of three, in wig and make-up that made him look convincingly ancient though still capable of moving like a bolt of lightning when he caught sight of a mirror in Harker's luggage.

He was rejuvenated within a week, thanks to a diet of fresh claret direct from the jugular, while the lawyer slept.

'You do look rather drained,' the Count sympathised to Harker. Many of the genre's traditions were faithfully observed – the secret passage behind an ancestral portrait, the colony of screaming bats, the skeletal incubus at the bedside.

But Gatiss and Moffat gleefully turned others inside out, sometimes literally.

Vampires and werewolves are usually separate species. But, as in the original novel, Dracula was able to take the guise of a wolf – and turned up on all four paws at the convent to which Harker had fled.

Challenged to show himself by a bold nun, he tore his way out of the wolf's entrails, leered at the quivering sisters and lisped: 'I don't know about you, girls, but I do love a bit of fur.'

That bold nun (Dolly Wells) delivered the cleverest twist.

She introduced herself as Sister Agatha, and she wasn't noticeably godly – though a Bride of Christ, she described herself as 'trapped in a loveless marriage for the sake of keeping a roof over my head'.

When she interviewed Harker, who was decomposing before our eyes, she brought along a novice nun as a chaperone and claimed: 'I can't be trusted around men.'

We guessed long before Harker that this novitiate was really his fiancee Mina Murray (Morfydd Clark) in disguise.

What I certainly didn't guess was that Sister Aggie was actually the vampire hunter Van Helsing.

Wells, previously known for her improvised sitcom Doll & Em, was a match at every step for Claes Bang.

This is not a production for delicate souls. There were images of true horror: The broken-jointed corpses climbing out of their packing cases, the hollow-eyed baby lurching forwards to feed on an impaled maiden, and most of all those fingernails... sliding off Harker's hands like loose orange peel.

Aarrghhh! One touch was especially impressive. In the whole hour-and-a-half, we didn't hear a syllable of foul language – blasphemy, certainly, but no obscenities, no four-letter swearwords.

Dracula's shocks were far more savage than that.","You do?It’s a proper job, is what I’m saying.Primal fears inescapably roused.Also, top nunning.He looks a half-formed thing – bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds’ irradiated Deadpool – as well, it turns out, he might.","By taking all the elements they love most from all their favourite versions, the duo salute the past while creating an entirely original vision.But, as in the original novel, Dracula was able to take the guise of a wolf – and turned up on all four paws at the convent to which Harker had fled.When she interviewed Harker, who was decomposing before our eyes, she brought along a novice nun as a chaperone and claimed: 'I can't be trusted around men.'What I certainly didn't guess was that Sister Aggie was actually the vampire hunter Van Helsing.One touch was especially impressive.",,

When it was announced in April that Britain’s longest-running soap, Coronation Street, would be introducing its first black family, the response was one of shock and incredulousness. Lenny Henry simply tweeted “wow” at the news, while theatre director Matthew Xia asked: “How have the producers managed to get away with this for almost 60 years?”

Though Corrie introduced its first black character – Shirley Armitage, played by Lisa Lewis – in 1983, the arrival of the Baileys was a major step forward for the 59-year-old soap, coming almost 30 years after the Taverniers arrived in EastEnders’ Albert Square in 1990. The Bailey family would include the usual mix of high drama and plausibility – patriarch Edison with his gambling addiction, eldest son and wheeler-dealer Michael, youngest son James, a gay footballer, and kindly matriarch Aggie.

“Coronation Street is a national treasure,” says Trevor Michael Georges, who plays Edison, “so when they announced they were looking for their first black family, that marked a real shift in mentality.” Georges has a history in opera and theatre, so Corrie marked a major shift for him, too. “The problem is not being the first of something but paving the way for the second or third,” he says. “That way you build a legacy and when you get to the third iteration, the novelty has worn off so you’re appreciated on your own merits.”

Still, with no precedent to fall back on, it has been tricky. “There is an immense pressure,” he says. “There is no one I can go to for advice. It has been nerve-racking, but we just have to set up the pathway for others to follow.”

With a storyline concerning racism and homophobia in football, Nathan Graham’s character, James, feels especially current. “It’s really important to shine a light on issues happening in the world,” he says. “We need to show all facets of James’s character and not stereotype him. Representation is increasing – but we still need to stay authentic.”

Corrie might be the nation’s favourite soap, but, with viewing figures dropping across the board, there’s hope this injection of diversity will prove an incentive for new viewers to tune in.

“This family has been so welcomed,” says Lorna Laidlaw, who plays Aggie. So many of her friends and family have come back to Corrie because of the Baileys – and she has been contacted by younger BAME actors asking for advice on breaking into the industry. “Acting is really tough and there isn’t enough representation, so this is a role of a lifetime,” she says. “I don’t see why we shouldn’t have more open casting now. Why we can’t have a black lawyer or black businessman on TV, too?”","Flights: Man condemned for ‘lowest of the low’ deed in airport - should he be arrested?The shocking moment was caught on film by another traveller, who shared it with Instagram account @PassengerShaming.

In the video, the man can be seen sitting in a waiting area alongside other passengers.

In a New Year message, Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, said the country's most influential business lobby known as Keidanren hopes to further develop digital technologies to make people's lives happier and solve social problems.

He said the business lobby will be committed to rule-making for digital transformation and economic structural reforms to address the graying and decreasing population in the country.

Nakanishi also said Keidanren welcomes the entry into force Wednesday of a Japan-U.S. trade deal, which lowers tariffs on farm and industrial goods, agreed on by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Donald Trump in September.

""We will promote private-sector diplomacy to maintain and strengthen free and open international economic order in the hope of contributing to stability and growth of the global economy,"" Nakanishi said.

Kengo Sakurada, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, called on Japan to take initiative in rule-making on use of digital data and taxation of information technology giants.

""Japan needs to compile its own regulations and rules on digital data ahead of overseas countries,"" Sakurada said. He especially sought deregulation in the fields of online medical services and autonomous driving.

Sakurada also urged Japan to express its determination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with its cutting-edge technologies.

Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it is urgently needed to introduce digital technologies to small and midsize firms across the country to increase their productivity.

To boost the regional economy, Mimura said the chamber aims to make the most of indigenous resources and external demand including inbound travelers to promote local tourism and the tie-up among agricultural, commercial and manufacturing sectors.

WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. health officials will ban most flavored e-cigarettes popular with underage teenagers.

President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, “We’re going to protect our families, we’re going to protect our children, and we’re going to protect the industry.""

But the plan from the Trump administration includes major exceptions that benefit companies that make and sell e-cigarettes and adults who use the nicotine-emitting devices.

Trump was vague about what the plan would entail but suggested “certain flavors” in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market “for a period of time.""

The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday the policy won't affect menthol or tobacco flavors.

The policy also won't affect large, tank-based vaping products sold in vape shops that cater to adults.

Those changes are a major step back from President Donald Trump's original plan announced in September, which would have banned nearly all flavors in all vaping products.

Beginning in May, All e-cigarettes will need to undergo FDA review. Only those that can demonstrate a benefit for U.S. public health will be permitted to stay on the market.","Business leaders to boost digital innovationBusiness leaders in Japan on Wednesday underlined their determination to further boost digital innovation this year as part of efforts for the country to lead the global economy.In a New Year message, Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, said the country's most influential business lobby known as Keidanren hopes to further develop digital technologies to make people's lives happier and solve social problems.Nakanishi also said Keidanren welcomes the entry into force Wednesday of a Japan-U.S. trade deal, which lowers tariffs on farm and industrial goods, agreed on by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Donald Trump in September.""Japan needs to compile its own regulations and rules on digital data ahead of overseas countries,"" Sakurada said.Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it is urgently needed to introduce digital technologies to small and midsize firms across the country to increase their productivity.","President Trump's plan to curb teen vaping exempts some flavorsPresident Trump's plan to curb teen vaping exempts some flavors

New Year’s with Tiffany Norton

New Hope Cinema Grill

Tiffany Norton, who has been the queen of New Year’s Eve in New Hope for years, will take the headliner slot for this big year-end show. Norton has been one of the most impressive comedy stories of the past decade, transforming from part-time performer to must-see headliner at night, all while waking up early as part of KS95’s morning show. This show is definitely worth the drive out to the ‘burbs. 8:30 p.m. $19. 2749 Winnetka Ave. N., New Hope; 763-417-0017.

New Year’s Eve Comedy and Dance Party

Dance Love Studio

Why choose between comedy, dancing, and partying into the New Year? Dance Love Studio will have the best of all three on New Year’s Eve, with comedians Ali Sultan, Greg Coleman, Shawn Nasfstad, and Abenezer Merdassa providing the jokes. Sultan and Coleman are two of the most seasoned headliners in town, and both are worth the price of admission on their own. Meanwhile, Nafstad and Merdassa are two of the fastest-rising up-and-coming voices in comedy, and will likely find themselves headlining their own New Year’s Eve shows in 2020. Get there early, as the comedy will get the party started for the evening at 9 p.m. From there, you can get up and move with a mini dance lesson from Hanna Esparza, then hit the open floor starting at 10:45 p.m. with DJ Salman and DJ Luv. You’ll be able to countdown to the New Year at midnight, celebrate with a toast, sloppily hug and high-five everyone, and then keep the party going until 2 a.m. 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. $20/$30 at the door. 2601 Second Ave. S., Minneapolis.

East Coast-Style New Year’s Eve

Sisyphus Brewing

For anyone who loves to celebrate but also likes going to bed a reasonable time, Maggie Faris has your back. Faris is once again presenting her East Coast-Style New Year’s Eve event, with a stacked lineup of comedians and plenty of surprises. The best part? Each show ends with a full-blown New Year’s countdown (the late show ends at 11 p.m., or midnight on the East Coast -- get it?), with champagne and confetti and all the pomp and circumstance you could ask for $25 bucks. This year’s shows will feature Faris, alongside Amber Preston, who made her mark as an Acme regular before taking over Los Angeles the past several years, and headliner David Dyer, who is best known as part of the Bob and Tom radio show. One of the staples of Faris’ events has become her affinity for booby prizes, and this year’s East Coast blowout will be no exception. Trust us, they will be ridiculous. There are two sets, giving you plenty of time to get home and relieve the babysitter before the “real” parties start, or sneak off to another bar to watch the ball drop and countdown to midnight for real. 7 and 9 p.m. $25. 712 Ontario Ave. W., Minneapolis; 612-444-8674.

Also, these comedy shows are recommended by City Pages writers:



Lizz Winstead: Sharknado X

The Cedar Cultural Center

When recounting the entire history of civilization, the last 10 years is just a blip. But when you’re living through a decade of political malaise, cultural anxiety, economic uncertainty, and environmental deterioration, things can feel like a series of escalating catastrophes. Thankfully Lizz Winstead, the socially astute comic who co-created satirical news staple The Daily Show, has been here all the while to provide cathartic laughter at her popular New Year’s Eve retrospectives. In recapping a 365 days worth of absurdities, Winstead brings an insightful perspective, infusing the most exasperating events with much needed levity. That said, even Winstead’s formidable comic skills are certain to be tested when consolidating an entire irrational decade into one hilarious presentation. Winstead, accompanied by guitarist Sam Breckenridge, will evoke laughter from this period of prolonged tension, hopefully imbuing a bit of hope as we enter a new decade. 7:30 p.m. $50/$60; $70 VIP. 416 Cedar Ave. S., Minneapolis; 612-338-2674. --Brad Richason

Sean Donnelly

Rick Bronson's House of Comedy

“I’m newly divorced, which is a bit of a bummer. But I’m doing good,” says comedian Sean Donnelly. “I just did a spot on Tracy Morgan’s show, The Last O.G., playing a security guard, and I’ve been doing tons of standup as usual.” Onstage, Donnelly is talking about everything from U.F.O.s to social media. “I had A.D.D. as a kid,” he says of the latter. “Social media is like my brain, but as a collective unit. After a few days, we can’t remember what we were upset about or who we were mad at.” Donnelly reckons we’re headed back to 1996 as people back away from social media. “I already see it happening. People say, ‘I check my email and maybe look up a recipe.’ Even the tech companies have caught on, offering features that let you lock yourself out of the internet for awhile.” He likens it to how bars were years ago. “They used to say in bars, ‘No politics or religion.’ I think that’s kind of good. I’m not saying we can’t talk about things, but we can still be friends and have different opinions. Family members are unfriending each other. People need to chill out. One thing doesn’t define a person.” 7 and 10 p.m. $25-$55.95. 408 E. Broadway, Mall of America, Bloomington; 952-858-8558. --P.F. Wilson

Bengt Washburn

Acme Comedy Co.

“I’m in an airport in Costa Rica,” Bengt Washburn tells us. “I did a cruise ship gig last week and this is where I get off.” For years, working the boats, as they say, wasn’t the most desirable gig in comedy, but Washburn says times have changed. “I don’t mind it,” he says. “Older audiences now are pretty hip. When I first started, they didn’t know what standup was. Now, if you have an audience of 50 and 60 year olds, they know who Carlin is; they get it.” Washburn doesn’t work blue, but there are still things that seem otherwise innocuous that he can’t joke about on ships. “I still do clubs. That’s where I do the writing,” he says. His PG/PG-13 style earned him two specials on Dry Bar Comedy, a website and production company that favors clean standup. “My last special for them was called Not Bad,” he explains. “At Acme, I’ll be doing the ‘Sort of Bad’ show. It’s all the stuff from Not Bad, but not truncated. It goes a little further.” For example, he’ll be able to touch on some social and political topics that he couldn’t do at sea. “That would start a fight on a ship,” he adds. “But it would be pretty funny given the age group. Someone would tip over and die.” 8 and 10:30 p.m. $30; $60 with dinner. 708 N. First St., Minneapolis; 612-338-6393. --P.F. Wilson

My parents and I would gather with one or two of my uncle’s families. It was the only night of the year we could hang out until midnight. The evening was spent making confetti out of colored paper, getting our homemade noise-makers of pans and wooden ladles ready, and setting the stage so we could scream and yell the New Year into existence.

The television was always on, of course, bouncing between the various New Year’s celebrations being covered on the networks. Anyone who was doing the same thing with their family this year may have been treated to Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen discussing a story about Cooper’s mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, wondering if she was going to be asked who had the largest “cock” in Hollywood.

No big deal, right? It’s 2020. Old sensibilities are out and penis stories are in. Sorry, but no. That’s not how this works. The constant virtue signaling by mainstream media prohibits us from dismissing when they decide inappropriate things are suddenly appropriate.

As Twitter celebrity Carpe Donktum noted, the hypocrisy at CNN, Cooper’s home network, is thick.

One of the biggest threats of Cultural Marxism is taking things that are rightly considered inappropriate and normalizing them for children in modern society. Have most kids heard worse than, “He’s not going to ask me who has the biggest cock in Hollywood, is he?” Yes. Does that make it okay for Anderson Cooper to ask it live on CNN on New Year’s Eve night. No. When we accept such things without objection, we’re acknowledging that the Cultural Marxists have already won.

Revelry is no excuse for retelling of adult stories on live television. Anderson Cooper stepped in it on this one, but we shouldn’t expect anything from CNN. Not an apology. Not even an acknowledgement. We need to set a better tone for 2020.

The alarming rate of out-of-school children in the country has continued to draw concern and intervention from all fronts, among which is the annual National Literary Competition, launched in 2014 by Lafarge Africa to create more literacy enhancement opportunities for indigent students across Nigeria. According to the company, promoting literacy and education has proven to be an eﬀective approach to alleviating poverty and improving the well-being of a society, as well as achieving equality and fostering sustainable development.

However it cited a UNESCO report, which stated that globally, approximately 758 million adults (15 per cent of global population) remain illiterate with women constituting two-third and Sub-Saharan Africa home to 26 per cent of world’s illiteracy rate. “In Nigeria, it is estimated that just a little above half of the adult population is literate (about 57 per cent), while youth literacy rate is less than 70 per cent.

“Yet, rates vary hugely between states, regions and sex. An in-depth survey by the National Bureau of Statistics reveal that Imo and Lagos States record the highest number of English literate adults at 80.8 per cent and 80.5 per cent respectively, while Sokoto State has only 22.1 per cent of its adult population literate in English Language. According to the 2010 National Literacy Survey, urban literacy surpasses rural at a huge ratio of 69.4 per cent to 38.5 per cent, while 65.1 per cent of males are literate as opposed to 50.6 per cent females.

“These estimates reveal that approximately 65 million Nigerians still remain illiterate, while over 10 million children are out of school (UNICEF 2014).” Thus with support of the Ovie Brume Foundation (OBF) and State Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEB), the Lafarge Africa National Literacy Competition was launched in 2014 as an annual contest conducted at the state, regional and national levels. After being coached in spelling, pronunciation, essay writing, and summary writing using specially developed study guides, select pupils compete in a state run-oﬀ, which sees two candidates (one male and one female) emerge to compete at the regional levels. The winning regions then proceed to the grand ﬁnale, where six winners emerge.

The competition also aims at enabling pupils to further enhance their language and vocabulary skills with the overall goal of enhancing the participants’ literacy skills (reading, writing, pronunciation and spelling) and improving their educational opportunities. It features reading assessment test- a questionnaire of 40 objective questions in English Language; summary writing, written at respective venues; essay writing also written at respective venues; Spelling Bee – a spelling- off competition across primary schools in 374 local government areas in Nigeria.

The initiative started in 2014 as ‘Reading Project’- a community integrated literacy enhancement initiative across ﬁve locations (Ewekoro, Sagamu, Onne, Ashaka and Lagos). where Lafarge Africa employees under the Lafarge friends of Communities (FOC) go into schools and read with pupils and support them on literacy; 950 story books were distributed across ﬁve locations to reach 250 beneﬁciaries. The initiative recorded an increase in the literacy skills of beneﬁciaries ranging from 9 per cent to 63 per cent.

The phase II was implemented across ﬁve locations – Ewekoro, Sagamu, Onne, Ashaka and Lagos; it was implemented in ﬁve schools across the aforementioned project sites and the target was to increase by at least 25 per cent the literacy skills of 500 primary school children in communities where Lafarge Africa operates. A total of 668 pupils were exposed to literacy intervention and 234 were reached.

Since the inception of the initiative, the company said there have been remarkable improvements in literacy skills among beneﬁciary primary school pupils across the country. By 2016, it said a total of 77,144 primary school pupils were reached in 244 local government areas, of which the 1,465 who actively participated in the competition remarkably displayed the ability to spell quickly, accurately and with comprehension, due to the contents of the initiative.

The maiden edition of the competition was won by students from Akwa Ibom State, while Ondo and Bauchi States came second and third respectively. In the 2015 edition, participants from Rivers, Lagos and Kogi States came first, second and third positions respectively. For the 2016 edition, Lagos, Plateau and Enugu States produced the first, second and third place winners.

In the 2017 edition of the competition, Edo State came first, while Ondo and Kano States came second and third respectively. In 2018, Lagos State emerged winner, while Ebonyi and Gombe States came second and third respectively. In the 2019 competition with the theme ‘Bridging the Literacy Gap Together’, Master David Emmanuella and Miss Barikpoa Prosper from Community Primary School, Rivers State emerged winner, while Ogun and Enugu States came second and third respectively. The winners were awarded scholarships, trophies and various gifts.

The grand finale event, which attracted key stakeholders from the public and private sectors, was also an opportunity for the children to engage and interact among themselves, explore various book exhibition stands, take reading sessions and also participate in a spelling bee competition.

Speaking at the event, which held in Lagos, the Chairman of Lafarge Africa Plc, Mr. Mobolaji Balogun said: “Literacy is crucial to the development of any society and it is described by UNESCO as a driver for sustainable development in that it enables greater participation in the labour market. It improves child and family health and nutrition, reduces poverty and expands life opportunities.”

He said that as an organisation, Lafarge Africa continues to invest in educational interventions, including scholarship and bursary awards for children within its host communities, training programmes, renovation and construction of classroom blocks and other facilities within schools, computer training, skills acquisition programmes among others.

“For a country like Nigeria, there is an urgent need to work towards securing a sustainable future. We believe that a sustainable future will enable growth, global peace and security and technological advancement. We need to prepare our children for a future where they will compete globally with ease. That future begins with improving the literacy levels of every child in Nigeria today,” he said.

The Country Chief Executive Officer, Lafarge Africa, Mr. Michel Puchercos, who commended all the students that participated at every stage of the competition, said “it is rewarding to watch these brilliant children grow and improve every year. We dream of a bright future for every Nigerian child through basic education.

“Six years on, the visible outcomes we have seen encourage us to do more. We have touched the lives of more than 700,000 primary school pupils in 1,665 schools across 544 local government areas. The competition is delivered across all 109 senatorial districts in all 36 states of the federation and the FCT and is organised with the support of the SUBEBs in all the states, with our implementing partners- Ovie Brume Foundation and TEP Centre.”

Puchercos added: “As a company, we are proud of this achievement and do believe that it will inspire more well-meaning Nigerians and citizens all over Africa and the world to contribute to improving the lives of the people around them in any way they can.”

The special guest of honour, the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, commended the company for taking up the initiative to bridge the country’s widening literacy gap. He expressed his passion for children and women and urged more companies to join hands against illiteracy. “We spend a lot on government and infrastructure, but there isn’t enough being spent on education for children.”

Emphasising reasons for the initiative by Lafarge, the Communications, Public Affairs and Sustainable Development Director, Lafarge Africa, Folashade Ambrose-Medebem said: “We have been doing this successfully for the past six years and we are quite happy with the positive impact we have made so far. This year, we are excited to have existing and new partners on board with us, like the British Council, Sterling Bank and Oando Foundation. We look forward to what we will achieve together. We believe that as we continue on this journey, there is room for more partnerships as there is still a lot to be done. The literacy competition is part of our overall sustainable development strategy; our sustainability ambitions which have four pillars- climate and energy, circular economy, environment and community- each with specific actions and targets to ensure we achieve them.’’ she said.

According to the Sustainable Development and Corporate Brand Manager, Titilope Oguntuga: “Lafarge Africa’s annual National Literacy Competition is an intervention in Nigeria’s education sector in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal four, which focuses on ensuring inclusive quality education and learning opportunities for all. It is also part of the company’s overall sustainability ambition hinged on four pillars, including climate and energy, circular economy, environment, and community. Our annual National Literacy Competition sits under the community pillar.”

Oguntuga said over the past six years, the company has continued to introduce new ideas as a way of improving the competition and making it bigger. “This year, we introduced the computer based testing (CBT) for the first time as a mode of assessment. The tests include a reading assessment exam using a questionnaire of forty objective questions, summary writing, essay writing and an off competition spelling bee.”

Responding, the overall winners, who also got scholarships to complete their secondary education, thanked the company and expressed delight at the opportunity to participate and the joy of emerging winners.","Jumia, DHL, and Alibaba will face off in African ecommerce 2.0 – TechCrunchThe business of selling consumer goods and services online is a relatively young endeavor across Africa, but ecommerce is set to boom.

Over the last eight years, the sector has seen its first phase of big VC fundings, startup duels and attrition.

To date, scaling e-commerce in Africa has straddled the line of challenge and opportunity, perhaps more than any other market in the world. Across major African economies, many of the requisites for online retail — internet access, digital payment adoption, and 3PL delivery options — have been severely lacking.

Still, startups jumped into this market for the chance to digitize a share of Africa’s fast growing consumer spending, expected to top $2 billion by 2025.

African e-commerce 2.0 will include some old and new players, play out across more countries, place more priority on internet services, and see the entry of China.

But before highlighting several things to look out for in the future of digital-retail on the continent, a look back is beneficial.

Jumia vs. Konga

The early years for development of African online shopping largely played out in Nigeria (and to some extent South Africa). Anyone who visited Nigeria from 2012 to 2016 likely saw evidence of one of the continent’s early e-commerce showdowns. Nigeria had its own Coke vs. Pepsi-like duel — a race between ventures Konga and Jumia to out-advertise and out-discount each other in a quest to scale online shopping in Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation.

Traveling in Lagos traffic, large billboards for each startup faced off across the skyline, as their delivery motorcycles buzzed between stopped cars.

Covering each company early on, it appeared a battle of VC attrition. The challenge: who could continue to raise enough capital to absorb the losses of simultaneously capturing and creating an e-commerce market in notoriously difficult conditions.

In addition to the aforementioned challenges, Nigeria also had (and continues to have) shoddy electricity.

Both Konga — founded by Nigerian Sim Shagaya — and Jumia — originally founded by two Nigerians and two Frenchman — were forced to burn capital building fulfillment operations most e-commerce startups source to third parties.

That included their own delivery and payment services (KongaPay and JumiaPay). In addition to sales of goods from mobile-phones to diapers, both startups also began experimenting with verticals for internet based services, such as food-delivery and classifieds.

While Jumia and Konga were competing in Nigeria, there was another VC driven race for e-commerce playing out in South Africa — the continent’s second largest and most advanced economy.

E-tailers Takealot and Kalahari had been jockeying for market share since 2011 after raising capital in the hundreds of millions of dollars from investors Naspers and U.S. fund Tiger Global Management.

So how did things turn out in West and Southern Africa? In 2014, the lead investor of a flailing Kalahari — Naspers — facilitated a merger with Takealot (that was more of an acquisition). They nixed the Kalahari brand in 2016 and bought out Takelot’s largest investor, Tiger Global, in 2018. Takealot is now South Africa’s leading e-commerce site by market share, but only operates in one country.

In Nigeria, by 2016 Jumia had outpaced its rival Konga in Alexa ratings (6 vs 14), while out-raising Konga (with backing of Goldman Sachs) to become Africa’s first VC backed, startup unicorn. By early 2018, Konga was purchased in a distressed acquisition and faded away as a competitor to Jumia.

Jumia went on to expand online goods and services verticals into 14 Africa countries (though it recently exited a few) and in April 2019 raised over $200 million in an NYSE IPO — the first on a major exchange for a VC-backed startup operating in Africa.

Jumia’s had bumpy road since going public — losing significant share-value after a short-sell attack earlier in 2019 — but the continent’s leading e-commerce company still has heap of capital and generates $100 million in revenues (even with losses).","“In Nigeria, it is estimated that just a little above half of the adult population is literate (about 57 per cent), while youth literacy rate is less than 70 per cent.The winning regions then proceed to the grand ﬁnale, where six winners emerge.A total of 668 pupils were exposed to literacy intervention and 234 were reached.In the 2017 edition of the competition, Edo State came first, while Ondo and Kano States came second and third respectively.“This year, we introduced the computer based testing (CBT) for the first time as a mode of assessment.","Over the last eight years, the sector has seen its first phase of big VC fundings, startup duels and attrition.In addition to the aforementioned challenges, Nigeria also had (and continues to have) shoddy electricity.While Jumia and Konga were competing in Nigeria, there was another VC driven race for e-commerce playing out in South Africa — the continent’s second largest and most advanced economy.In Nigeria, by 2016 Jumia had outpaced its rival Konga in Alexa ratings (6 vs 14), while out-raising Konga (with backing of Goldman Sachs) to become Africa’s first VC backed, startup unicorn.Jumia went on to expand online goods and services verticals into 14 Africa countries (though it recently exited a few) and in April 2019 raised over $200 million in an NYSE IPO — the first on a major exchange for a VC-backed startup operating in Africa.",,

HF: At Caulfield Grammar, where my father spent a lot of money getting me educated, I got the lowest score in maths ever recorded in the history of education.

MC: Another proud moment.

HF: Yeah, but that was at 15 and I worked out recently in my last AC/DC concert my budget was $6.5 million, so I faked it pretty good.

MC: Let's talk about some of the huge names you have worked with. Who was the first big act?

HF: The most memorable human being to me was Billy Thorpe. When he started playing rock, he did a song at my venue once called, Cigarettes, whiskey and wild, wild woman. I was 18 at the time and I listened to the lyrics and went, 'yeah this for me'.

MC: Your first tour manager job was for a great Aussie band, Sherbet.

HF: Yeah and back then nobody knew what a touring manager did. I had a security business in Melbourne and I could count money, so I could handle myself and I was probably reasonable company then. I had hair and hips and half a brain.

MC: That was all the resume you needed.

HF: Absolutely.

MC: Explain to me what 24 hours looks like for roadie.

HF: It depends what era you are speaking. In the 80s it could be behind the wheel of a four-tonne truck driving overnight from Brisbane to Sydney after you've loaded out at 2am. You may find a hamburger on the way, you'd be drinking scotch or Bundy, you're probably smoking a joint and you could've done a line of speed. You'd arrive at approximately 1pm the next afternoon. You'd carry the gear upstairs, you'd set up and everyone would hate you because you haven't showered. And you'd probably do that again in Melbourne the night after.

MC: So why do it? What's the appeal?

HF: You do it for the people you love and work with, which is the band you represent. Somebody asked me, what was the greatest drug I had ever had. I said, when the house lights go down and the band starts playing music.

That doesn't matter whether it's a suburban pub with 20 people, or in a stadium with 100,000 people. You've built it and they have come.","Australian bushfire death toll rises to 18 as conditions expected to worsenAt least eight more people have been killed in catastrophic bushfires in Australia this week, bringing the death toll to 18, according to local reports.

Authorities are warning conditions will only get worse, with temperatures expected to exceed 115 degrees in some part of the country this weekend.

Out-of-control fires have raged for the past two months across Australia’s east coast, destroying at least 900 homes, killing half a billion animals and wiping out 30 percent of the country’s koala population, officials said.

Residents on Wednesday described scenes “like Armageddon” — the massive infernos razing homes, blanketing towns in thick toxic smoke and turning skies to a menacing blood red, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Among the dead are a father and son who stayed behind to defend their property, three young firefighters killed in the line of duty and two men who were discovered in burnt-out cars.

Large plumes of ash from the fire have now drifted as far as New Zealand — locals in the city of Queenstown on Tuesday sharing photos on social media of the thick orange haze and noting they could smell the smoke.

Images of trapped Australians wearing face masks and sheltering on beaches on New Years’s Eve went viral around the world this week, while Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced a groundswell of fury over his tepid response to the disaster.

With a heat wave predicted for later this week, authorities issued evacuation orders for large stretches of the New South Wales’ coast normally teeming with holidaymakers over the summer vacation period.

Long queues formed outside supermarkets and gas stations on Wednesday as stranded tourists and residents attempted to stock up on supplies, the Herald reported.

More than 50,000 residents on the New South Wales coast are currently without power while some towns no longer have access to clean drinking water, the report said.

Firefighters have struggled to contain the massive blazes — the worst in decades — with record temperatures and a prolonged drought exacerbating the disaster.","MC: All that when you were five?MC: Your first tour manager job was for a great Aussie band, Sherbet.HF: Yeah and back then nobody knew what a touring manager did.MC: Explain to me what 24 hours looks like for roadie.You've built it and they have come.","Authorities are warning conditions will only get worse, with temperatures expected to exceed 115 degrees in some part of the country this weekend.Residents on Wednesday described scenes “like Armageddon” — the massive infernos razing homes, blanketing towns in thick toxic smoke and turning skies to a menacing blood red, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.Images of trapped Australians wearing face masks and sheltering on beaches on New Years’s Eve went viral around the world this week, while Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced a groundswell of fury over his tepid response to the disaster.With a heat wave predicted for later this week, authorities issued evacuation orders for large stretches of the New South Wales’ coast normally teeming with holidaymakers over the summer vacation period.Long queues formed outside supermarkets and gas stations on Wednesday as stranded tourists and residents attempted to stock up on supplies, the Herald reported.","<s> Grundsteuer und Gewerbesteuer steigen in Hohenburg Die Gemeinde Hohenburg ist nach wie vor auf Stabilisierungshilfen des Freistaats angewiesen, um einen ausgeglichenen Haushalt aufstellen zu können.

The last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.

I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.

I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.

But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”

Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.

Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.

As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.

Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”

The gains have been established in research into baseline happiness – what in psychological literature is called our “hedonic set point”. It varies from person to person, but the key point is that our baseline is only half determined by genetics. “That means the other 50% is up to us,” says Kogan. “I think that is incredibly empowering.”

So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?

Identify the problem

Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, divide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.

There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.

The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest; it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.

The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.

The big picture

Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are; the idea is to shift your mindset.

Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”

Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.

Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.

What does it all mean?

Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.

Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”

Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.

Play is an effective mood‑booster that is often neglected in adulthood

The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”

Family fortunes

It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”

In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”

Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”

Home truths

If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”

Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.

Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.

Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”

Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.

To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”

The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.

Early to bed

Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”

Embracing boredom

In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.

Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you.

“Part of this exercise is to recognise that there isn’t anything out there that is going to make you feel good 100% of the time,” says Kogan. “That’s actually great news, because when we let go of this particular idea of happiness we give ourselves more opportunities to be in alignment with our lives.”","How to succeed at your New Year’s resolutions this year× How to succeed at your New Year’s resolutions this year

NEW YORK — Do you want to eat better, exercise more, stop vaping or lose weight?

Great. Now’s the time to set those New Year’s resolutions.

As we head into a year — and a new decade — your first step is to believe you can do it.

The opposite is also true, said University of Scranton psychology professor John C. Norcross, who has studied resolutions for decades. If you think you can’t do it, you’ll likely prove yourself right.

While about 40% of Americans set resolutions around January 1, about 40% to 44% of them will be successful at six months, said Norcross, reporting his results from multiple studies with colleagues.

But if you believe in yourself, you are 10 times more likely to change via a New Year’s resolution, compared to non-resolvers, when both groups have comparable goals and motivation, he reported.

Here’s how to start yourself on the strongest possible footing this year.

Make it specific

Eating better and exercising more are all nice ideas, but they’re too general and don’t give you a plan of action. People often think they lack motivation when the problem is really a lack of clarity, wrote author James Clear in his book, “Atomic Habits.”

“The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION],” writes Clear.

If you want to eat better, be specific: Resolve to add a fruit or vegetable to your lunch every day, limit fast food to once per week, or have dessert once a week.

Make it possible

Avoid resolutions that sound great but are unattainable. In fact, make them them something you will enjoy. They can still be hard, but that doesn’t mean they have to make you miserable.

To eat better, put that bowl of fruit right next to your lunch bag, so you grab an apple or orange every day. Hate apples? Don’t pick apples. Pick a fruit you are likely to eat.

To exercise more, you might want to run more. But if you’re a night person, don’t make it harder on yourself by trying to run every morning before work, said Gretchen Rubin, author of “The Happiness Project.” Do it after work.

Want to meditate? Great. Rubin hates meditating, so she stopped doing it. It’s ok to experiment and stop doing things you don’t like. “Know who you are, and who you’re not,” she said.

Allow yourself to fail

Everyone screws up. Expect to have occasional slips. But don’t let the occasional missed exercise class or Friday workplace donut throw you off course, explained Norcross.

Most successful resolvers slip in January, but 71% of successful resolvers say their first slip strengthened their efforts through a combination of guilt, increasing awareness of their problem’s severity, and the slip reminding them to refine their plans, he said.

If you know you’re walking into a high pressure situation, practice saying “no thanks” to your aunt’s apple pie in advance. Even people who don’t like apple pie sometimes still eat it when offered just to be polite. Instead, practice saying “No, thank you.”

And if you do slip? Focus on getting back on track, not the slip. “The people who show more compassion for themselves are more likely to get back on the horse and try again,” Rubin said.

Set yourself up for success

See what they tell you: If you’re resolved to spend less time on your phone but grab it as soon as you wake up, put your phone in another room at night. Oh, it’s your alarm, you say? Buy an alarm clock. They cost $6 now.

If you want to limit sweets, get them out of your house. Stay away from your work’s break room during Wednesday snack time (not that I’m speaking from personal experience at CNN).

Know yourself

Rather than asking you to consider your goals, Clear asks you to consider this two-step process.

Decide the type of person you want to be: A healthy person? A strong person? A writer? A musician?

Then prove it to yourself with small wins over time. Gym classes, weight lifting, writing, practicing. Every time you do something toward the goal of you who want to be, tell yourself that you are becoming that person. (I did my Pilates in the morning before I started writing this piece. It’s part of my goal to be a healthy person.)

Make it public

If you’re surrounded by supportive friends and family, making your goals public and asking for accountability can help. So can joining a gym with friendly competition or a group like Weight Watchers.

The resolution guides I spoke to agreed to go public with their resolutions: Norcross resolved to stop multitasking in 2020, and he had already started practicing during our telephone interview. (After he mentioned it, I did feel like I had his full attention.)

Psychologist Lisa Damour, author of “Under Pressure” about the lives of teen girls, plans to focus on meditating in 2020, despite having two children and a more-than-full-time career.

“I’m going to start at five minutes daily,” she said, crediting James Clear with starting a daily “atomic habit” before trying for more.

Rubin is going to try to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art every day she’s home in Manhattan, a few blocks from the museum.

While that sounds like a tall order, it’s also the subject of her next book — so it’s huge motivation to explore and learn from her new workplace in the new year.

Show (don’t tell) your children

Parents can open the door to a conversation with their children about resolutions by talking about their own reflections and hopes for the new year. They can mention that it’s hard to meet their own goals, and that perfection is not the goal.

Parents can bring up the changes they want to make and model how they want to make those changes, said Damour. It’s important to bring it up without criticizing, she said.

With children under age 10, parents can take the lead in a discussion about where family members have room to grow, she said. Once your children get to adolescence, don’t give them any ideas, she added.

“Parents should work with the assumption that no normally developing teenager wants to be told what to do,” said Damour. If the teenager is quietly doing the right thing and the parent suggests it, kids will likely stop doing it.

“Most of how we guide young people is modeling the behaviors we want,” she said. “If what you say and do don’t match, a teenager will notice and call you on your hypocrisy.”

Change it up

Do you just hate the idea of a resolution for the entire year, seeing an entire year of failure ahead of you? Follow in CNN Features Editor David Allan’s footsteps and set yourself a year of 12 monthly micro-resolutions. In 2018, he eliminated one behavior each month — think alcohol, sweets, screens around his kids, saying the word “like” — and noted the impact of his mood and the effect on himself and his family.

It went so well, this past year he decided to add something to his life every month, including meditation, movement, active listening and more sleep.

Getting enough sleep didn’t go so well for him one month, so he swapped it out. He wrote his own rules, so he could change them and therefore succeed. And you can, too.","Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.“I think that is incredibly empowering.”

With Jürgen Klopp’s men threatening to dominate the coming decade there has never been a better time to be a Kopite. Melwood has been preparing for this coming period of dominance, we believe Curtis Jones will be the breakthrough star of 2020.

Jones has been at Anfield since he was a kid, first turning out for the club at under-nine level. He has rocketed through the ranks at Melwood, impressing at every level, often captaining his side.

The local lad made his first debut in January 2019, starting against Wolves in the FA Cup, he has since collected the man of the match award for his efforts against MK Dons in the League Cup, he scored the winning penalty against Arsenal in the next round.

Jones’ Premier League debut came during the Reds’ 3-0 win over Bournemouth at the start of December. We can expect more first team minutes for him in the near future.

Curtis Jones will surely be our breakthrough star of 2020 as it is the perfect time for him. The Reds have their strongest squad in modern history, there will be plenty of games where we are leading handsomely enough to bring on one of the youngsters.

As long as Jones continues to impress during the cameos we can expect him to win a few starts. The intense footballing style of Klopp’s Liverpool demands rotation, we need to keep our players refreshed in order to maintain our high press – Jones could benefit from this rotation.

Of course, Jones may also benefit from our vast lead at the top of the table, if the Reds were to win the league with time to spare, we may see the gaffer blood some young talent.","EPL: Wenger speaks on Liverpool going unbeaten, winning title this seasonFormer Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has disclosed that Liverpool are on course to go unbeaten and win the Premier League title this season.

Liverpool wrapped up their 17th win of the campaign with a 4-0 win over second-placed Leicester City on Boxing Day.

The Reds have only dropped points against Manchester United so far this season.

But Wenger now believes that Jurgen Klopp’s men are on the right track to repeat Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ feat of 2003/2004 this term.

Asked whether Liverpool can pull off an ‘Invincibles’ season, Wenger told beIN SPORTS: “They were close last year and they are still on course to do it.

“But I think what Liverpool is expecting at the moment is just to win the Premier League and that is the first target for such a football city.

The biggest legends in American baseball history all set records and achieved international fame playing with Louisville Slugger bats, the players’ names immortalized in the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Hall of Fame in Kentucky.

But what about the men and women who worked in the factories, the artisans and engravers who produced their iconic bats for America’s favorite pastime? What were their names, and what were their stories?

Those are the questions being answered right now in Louisville, Kentucky. As part of the city’s biennial celebration, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory dug out a trove of old photos, many black and white, from decades and decades of the company’s history. The pictures were a snapshot into not only the company’s past but of post-war American life. But many of the proud faces’ identities were unknown.

Ruby Judd worked at Louisville Slugger for 50 years filling ordered filling orders and doing quality inspection. She was identified by her niece, Laura Quiggins, who said: ‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out'

An unidentified man whittles down a baseball bat. In celebration of Louisville, Kentucky's biennial, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is hosting an exhibit that showcases vintage photos of employees that worked in the Hillerich and Bradsby factory over the years. A local campaign asked family, friends and former colleagues to help identify the nameless faces

A local campaign advertised the museum exhibit and showcased the photos in regional media. That’s when friends and colleagues of former workers began collaborating with the effort, and now many of those earnest, nameless faces have been identified.

‘Back in those days, people took such pride in their work,’ says Laura Quiggins, who identified her aunt, Ruby Judd, who was an inspector and order filler more than 50 years ago for Hillerich and Bradsby, the company which began manufacturing Louisville Slugger bats. ‘Nowadays, it’s like people just go to work to get the paycheck – “What’s in it for me?”

‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘It’s so simple, but a little piece of wood made people famous, and those people made the bat famous.’

The effort came about when the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory was asked to participate in the Louisville Biennial, and curator Bailey Mazik thought of the photos she’d seen in archives and desks, folders of workers in the factories, men and women working for a company that began in 1856 and manufactured everything from butter churns to golf clubs to the famous bats – production of which began in 1884. The company receives information about former players on a daily basis, she says – but this was something new and special.

An unidentified employee is seen branding bats. Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 instantly recognized a former employee by the name of Georgia Hines. She told DailyMail.com: '...she was a little bitty lady. She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed...but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then'

‘One of our former vice presidents was kind of an amateur historian himself, so he collected a lot of these and organized these and wrote down a lot of employees’ names,’ Bailey Mazik says of Jack McGrath, who retired in the 80s.

She adds: ‘It has been important for us to know who these people are and to celebrate their hard work.’

One of those people was Quiggins’ Aunt Ruby.

‘She was an inspector and an order-filler,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘She inspected the bats and, when someone placed an order for them, she did the quality assurance … She had worked in several departments, because she was there for years.’

Aunt Ruby, who married and had two children, ‘loved her job,’ Quiggins says.

‘My grandfather worked with wood a lot and made things with wood, and he was a whittler. So she said going into work was like going into Dad’s house. She had built a big long 18-by-12 cedar closet in their house, so their house smelled like cedar – and she said that’s the only smell I don’t smell at work, is cedar. She smelled oak and all the other woods. She said it was a family-oriented place … Everybody knew everybody. She loved working there.

‘That was the place to work, back in the day. It was General Electric, Ford and Hillerich and Bradsby.’

The company has always been based in the Louisville region, and the Kentucky city has become almost synonymous with baseball bats. Tributes to players and their bats are included on a mile-long Walk of Fame through the city, and the Museum is easily identifiable by the world’s largest bat standing proudly outside of it.

Paula Dyer, another woman who identified her aunt and uncle – both Hillerich and Bradsby employees – echoed the sentiments of Ms Quiggins.

Hillerich and Bradsby was the ‘name I grew up with,’ she says. Her Aunt Polly and Uncle John ‘Buck’ Basham started in the 40s and retired in the 70s.

Buck was a WWII Army veteran, and Dyer’s mother and father had worked for Hillerich and Bradsby before leaving, helping her own parents get their jobs.

‘They would get up in the morning ... they were dedicated employees,’ Dyer says of Polly and Buck. They would get up at four in the morning; they would never be a minute late. They never missed a day.’

She adds: They were proud to work there, yes. It was hard work; they never complained too much about it. I remember, Uncle Buck, his hands would be stained.’

The Bashams were so proud, in fact, that they incorporated their company’s product into the cabin they built saving wages, she says.

‘It was a two-story cabin, beautiful cabin, and the stairs – instead of plain old rails on each step, it was a Hillerich and Bradsby baseball bat, she tells DailyMail.com. ‘And you know, none of us have pictures of it and it’s so sad.’

Uncle Buck died in 1976 at the age of 60 – only two years retired – and Aunt Polly passed away in 1999.

‘To be able to recognize them for their hard work and dedication ... I just love it,’ she says.

Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 as an 18-year-old on the switchboard, helped identify former workers from the binders of folders such as Georgia Heins.

The effort to name and picture so many people excited her and made her happy to help, she tells DailyMail.com.

‘It is a legacy,’ she says. ‘It goes back so many generations ... I think they realize the history.’

She adds that she still believes the company makes ‘the greatest bat in the world’ and ‘it’s as American as apple pie.’

She’s worked everywhere within the company from accounts payable to shipping and purchasing and in the warehouses and factories, helping her get to know so many employees over the years who were equally proud of their work. One of them was Georgia Heins, who she recognized amongst the pictures.

‘She was real nice; she was a little bitty lady,’ she says. ‘She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed and maybe with her pockets lined. She was 5’2, 5’1; she was a small woman, real skinny, but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then.'

She tells DailyMail.com that the company has always been ‘like a family.’

‘There was a lot of us that started young, so we were young and inexperienced. We learned off of some of the older ones, and we all started having babies and raising our families, and everybody was always here for everybody else.’

Many of the positions, she admits, ‘were tedious jobs – but they just had a little assembly line, and then you had a lot of husband and wives worked here. And then you had several that met their wives here and married.’

‘Years ago, whenever you had a baby, they used to send us a full-sized personalized bat with a letter from the president [of the company] saying: “Welcome to the Hillerich and Bradsby family.” And they would send us a personalized bat with the day they were born, their height, weight and all of that. So each of my kids have that.’

Archivist Mazik says that emphasis on connectivity and support has ‘been important and implemented in our company for as long as I can tell.

‘We all really make a point to know each other, all different departments, all different kinds of jobs. It has been really special to me to see how employees keep in touch with each other and how they take care of each other.’

The exhibit will run through the end of January, but Mazik hopes it can lead to even further historical research and memorialization of the people responsible for the building blocks of America’s favorite pastime.

‘I want to sit down with some of these folks, do formal oral histories that we can archive,’ she says.

She loved working there'","Frumpy Middle-aged Mom: My housekeeper is worth more to me than goldThis is without a doubt my favorite day that rolls around every two weeks, and I’m not talking about payday (though that’s up there pretty high as well.) Today is the day that my housekeeper comes to rescue me from my own sloth, and I never get tired of it, or bored by repetition, even though it occurs every two weeks. (I’m calling her Ronda but that’s not her real name.) Author Erma Bombeck once said that cleaning your house while the kids were still growing is like sweeping your porch while it’s still snowing and I think that’s true, but I still look forward to it.

Here are the happy stages of “Ronda The Housekeeper Day:”

Stage One

Go to the ATM and get some cash, because my kids always suck up any excess I have lying around. I pay Ronda around $20 an hour, which I think is fair for five hours of manual labor cleaning my toilet and mopping my floors. Occasionally, someone will act surprised at this, and insist they can get me someone cheaper. “Gee, I know someone who will clean your whole house for $30!” Well, here’s the thing: I’m not interested in exploiting people just because they’re desperate and will work for less. Ronda came to this country from Guatemala (She’s in this country legally now so don’t send me any hate mail, thank you) as a mom deserted by her abusive, alcoholic husband. She left her boys with her mother and came up here to find a job to support them. At first, she told me, she worked for room and board only, which in my mind sounds an awful lot like slavery. Not the only time I’ve heard that kind of story, by the way. I pay her what I think is fair, and if you bargain your cleaning lady down to get her to scrub your floors for less, I probably wouldn’t like you.

Stage Two

Scurry around and put away anything that I think might get misplaced. Two women putting things away in the same kitchen is never a good thing. I spend a lot of time pacing and thinking, “Dang, where would she have put the measuring cups?” It’s just easier to put them away before she gets here. I usually throw a load of towels in the washer to give her a head start, since she does our linens. Sometimes I’ll wipe up the dog vomit or something else that’s particularly disgusting, though I’m not one of those people who cleans the house before the housekeeper arrives. I’ve always been a little confused by that concept. I know there are a lot of you out there, so please explain it to me.

Stage Three

Greet Ronda when she arrives, then vamoose as quickly as possible. I don’t want to be around while she’s cleaning for two reasons. First, because I can tell I’m getting in her way, though she would never say so. The second and more important reason is that I feel guilty. I feel vaguely ashamed that I’m making someone else clean the gunk out of my bathroom sink, even though I know she wants and needs the work.

Best-selling author Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a piece for Harper’s magazine back in 2000 called “Maid to Order: The politics of other women’s work” that I could never get completely out of my head. She went to work as a employee of one of those corporate housekeeping companies for the experience, so she could write about it from an informed perspective.

She wrote that people like to hire cleaning services, because they needn’t have a relationship with one person and watch her scrub their bathtub. Seriously, do you really think those maids are merry? Because I’m pretty sure they’re not. Some people also worry about theft, though I’ve never had a problem. One of my former housekeepers, who fled the death squads in El Salvador, had been a college professor there, and the only problem I had with her was letting her finish her work, because she was so interesting I always just wanted to talk. My mother was a neat freak who grew up an orphan in Texas, where in those days the difference between “white trash” and respectable folk was how clean they kept their houses. My mom could never abide the fact that her daughter was clearly trash.

Stage Four

Come home to a sparkling, lemon-scented house with freshly folded towels and clean sheets, enjoying an hour of pure bliss after walking through the door. At this point, I might think about how I really can’t afford a housekeeper, and wonder which kid I should get rid of so I can continue to hire her services.

Stage Five

It’s been 24 hours since Ronda was here, and I’m wondering how my house could possibly look so trashed. I also wonder why my son needs five towels for one shower and why he can’t pick them up off the floor. There’s nothing to be done but pine for her next visit. Ronda, please come back!","‘Nowadays, it’s like people just go to work to get the paycheck – “What’s in it for me?”

Washington (AFP) - Illinois started the new year on a high note Wednesday, becoming the latest US state to legalize recreational marijuana as the governor pardoned thousands for past low-level cannabis convictions.

The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act will allow residents 21 and older to legally purchase marijuana and will expunge thousands of individuals' criminal convictions throughout the state.

""We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core,"" Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in a statement.

On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.

According to the statement, the new law will use 25 percent of the state's cannabis revenue to help ""the communities hit hardest"" by the earlier crackdown on marijuana.

""Today we took another step toward justice, as we continue to address the failed war on drugs and the disproportionate impact it had on communities of color,"" Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said in the statement.

Illinois residents age 21 and older will now be allowed to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC -- the main active ingredient of cannabis -- contained in a cannabis-infused product.

Non-residents are allowed to carry 15 grams of cannabis under the bill, which will also create a licensed growing and dispensary system.

Illinois is the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, along with Washington, DC. Thirty-four states and the federal capital permit medical cannabis treatment.

But the US Drug Enforcement Administration still considers marijuana a dangerous substance alongside LSD and heroin.

A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control published in August found that states that legalize recreational marijuana see a reduction of at least 20 percent in fatalities linked to opioid overdoses.

Marijuana legalization has also been shown to improve a state's economic activity, creating jobs and bringing in new tax revenue.","Illinois governor pardons more than 11,000 people for low-level pot offensesIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker granted more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions Tuesday — one day before a sweeping law makes cannabis legal in the state for people 21 and older.

The 11,017 pardons are a small part of the law Pritzker signed in June, making Illinois the 11th state in the nation to legalize weed use by adults. The law is also intended to help people held back from jobs, housing and financial aid for college because of drug convictions, according to state officials.

“We are ending the 50-year long war on cannabis,” the Democratic governor, who made the announcement at a church on Chicago’s South Side, said in a statement.

“We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core.”

State officials said about 116,000 convictions for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana — not associated with a violent crime — are eligible for pardons under the new law.

In all, the law could offer relief to the more than 700,000 residents with marijuana-related offenses on their criminal records, according to state officials and the Marijuana Policy Project.

The state’s new Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which takes effect Wednesday, allows people to automatically receive clemency for convictions up to 30 grams of cannabis. Those convicted with larger amounts, from 30 to 500 grams, can petition a court to have the charge lifted.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, in a statement Tuesday, applauded the governor for “acting to address the history of unnecessary and discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws in Illinois.”

“The governor’s pardons of Illinoisans with convictions for marijuana possession makes the new year brighter for thousands,” said Ben Ruddell, criminal justice policy director for the ACLU of Illinois.

“We know that black Illinois residents are far more likely to be arrested and convicted for marijuana possession than whites. This is a good step forward as we begin the legal sales of recreational marijuana.”

The law defines “expunge” to mean to “physically destroy the records or return them to the petitioner and to obliterate the petitioner’s name from any official index or public record, or both.” But it doesn’t require the physical destruction of circuit court files.

“The 11,017 pardons that Gov. Pritzker is granting today are thousands of lives forever changed — and hundreds of thousands more will be changed in the coming months,” Toi Hutchinson, senior adviser to the governor for cannabis control, said in a statement.

“Those who were unfairly targeted by discriminatory drug laws can finally get ahead and build a new future for themselves and their families.”

So far 18 states have decriminalized marijuana, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. In all, 34 states allow patients with health complaints to use medical marijuana.

Illinois is the latest state to offer clemency for marijuana convictions. In May, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that gave marijuana offenders the ability to have their sentences vacated in the state.","We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market.On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.According to the statement, the new law will use 25 percent of the state's cannabis revenue to help ""the communities hit hardest"" by the earlier crackdown on marijuana.Non-residents are allowed to carry 15 grams of cannabis under the bill, which will also create a licensed growing and dispensary system.Illinois is the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, along with Washington, DC.","Illinois governor pardons more than 11,000 people for low-level pot offensesIllinois Gov.“We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans.Those convicted with larger amounts, from 30 to 500 grams, can petition a court to have the charge lifted.In all, 34 states allow patients with health complaints to use medical marijuana.In May, Washington Gov.","<s> A new installment of Deadpool is coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

During the first week of December, notorious Ukrainian Nazis supported the West's color revolution destruction in Hong Kong.

Ihor Maliar, Serhii Sternenko and Serhii Filimonov are well known members of the Ukrainian Nazi groups, Azov Battalion and Right Sektor. They wear swastikas, iron crosses and other Nazi symbols, including their ubiquitous tattoos, as caught on camera in Hong Kong above. Both of these two fascist groups are funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other CIA front NGOs (https://sputniknews.com/asia/201912021077466396-why-are-ukrainian-neo-nazis-joining-the-hong-kong-protests/).

This is a particularly revolting affront to the Chinese people, of whom 25-35 million died during World War II, in helping to defeat global fascism. Given this 20th century history, these Ukie goons were surely sent to Hong Kong to get a reaction out of Baba Beijing, which will not happen (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/28/hong-kong-ensnared-in-the-wests-color-revolution-hot-box-the-latest-news-and-analysis-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191128/). These Nazis also created a color revolution Facebook group in Ukraine, called Free Hong Kong Center, as shown below. Sieg Heils, Herr CIA!

We can safely say that the CIA-NGO complex has connected their Hong Kong terrorists to Ukrainian Nazis to work together. I can't think of two groups that deserve each other more.

Treasonous leaders, like Joshua Wong, have flown to Taiwan, seeking help to destroy HK (http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aCS/201909030007.aspx).

Taiwan is part of a continuous nexus of anti-socialist-communist China color revolutions going back to Tiananmen Square in 1989 (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/05/30/over-100000-people-around-the-world-have-read-this-you-should-too-china-rising-radio-sinoland-190604/).

During March 2014, in precision organized scenes eerily similar to Hong Kong's, and right on the heels of the bloody, US orchestrated overthrow of the pro-Russian government in Ukraine (Maidan), students stormed the Taiwanese legislature, occupying it to protest a proposed law to increase commerce with the Mainland. It became known as the Sunflower Movement and had all the hallmarks of a Western organized and financed color revolution. It so shook Taiwan and was such a huge loss of face for the pro-Beijing KMT Party, that it heavily lost later local and national elections, putting into power the US backed/manipulated, secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Since then, cross-strait relations have gone from positive and productive to sour and confrontational. Chalk up a temporary and futile victory for Western imperialism.

Flash forward five years. When the Hong Kong color revolution terrorists stormed their legislature, they ransacked it, costing millions of dollars in damage, needing months of repairs. Not by coincidence, they painted in big Chinese-character graffiti,

Chinese President Xi Jinping is going to Macau this week, to join the 20th anniversary celebrations for the territory's return to the Motherland, after 450 years of Portuguese control (https://macaunews.mo/president-xi-jinping-to-arrive-on-december-18-government-sources-say/). He's staying three days, which is unprecedented and a statement in itself. Macau's history is much different than that of colonial Hong Kong, and you can feel the striking differences by visiting both. Mrs. Graça Pacheco Jorge did a great job of explaining this, in her written interview on China Rising Radio Sinoland. It is well worth reading (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/05/22/graca-pacheco-jorge-magical-and-mysterious-macau-the-anti-hong-kong-china-rising-radio-sinoland-190522/). She explains why Macau's reintegration into the Mainland China has been seamlessly successful.

During Xi's visit, it is expected that the development of a Macau stock market will be officially approved (https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1497360-20191212.htm). They even sold a Macau bond this week, worth US$730 million, to make another statement (https://www.chinanews.com/ga/2019/12-13/9033268.shtml). While not big by world standards, the message is clear. This is a direct result and an oblique riposte to the West's ongoing color revolution destruction of next-door Hong Kong (HK), something I have reported on extensively, since it began in 2014. This article/podcast gives a nice 10-point recap of the horrific events taking place there (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/28/hong-kong-ensnared-in-the-wests-color-revolution-hot-box-the-latest-news-and-analysis-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191128/). Hong Kong is still a British colony in all but name.

Pictured above: I think the Macanese are trying to give Xi Jinping a hint. Here they are with a mock stock market board and Wall-Street-esque gong, to welcome their first bond sold.

This is part of much bigger picture concerning Hong Kong's precarity. For years, Baba Beijing has been holding Shenzhen's and Guangzhou's airports back, so as to not hurt Hong Kong's economy, which is critically dependent on short-stay tourists. Every year, 60 million visitors pass through for a few days of eating, shopping and sightseeing. China has let Hong Kong keep air tickets cheap, relative to nearby mainland Shenzhen and Guangzhou, not to mention letting HK have many more and frequent regional and international destinations. Ticket prices and destinations are currently so competitive in Hong Kong, that huge numbers of people in Shenzhen and Guangzhou take the high-speed train and ferry there, to then fly around the world. My wife and I did it all the time, when we lived in Shenzhen for three years. Like all these millions of transiting Mainlanders, we would often stay 1-2 days coming and/or going, spending our money in the local economy.

If Baba Beijing gives the go-ahead to China's airlines to compete with Hong Kong out of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, it would cripple Hong Kong's economy. That hasn't happened yet, but clearly China giving Macau the green light to open a NASDAQ-style stock market is a harbinger to Western color revolution destroyed HK, since the latter has historical bragging rights as Asia's ""Wall Street"". Baba Beijing has been keeping Macau's stock market dreams on the back burner for 20 years. The fact that it is being given the go ahead now is no coincidence (http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1166751.shtml and http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1166969.shtml).","This is a particularly revolting affront to the Chinese people, of whom 25-35 million died during World War II, in helping to defeat global fascism.These Nazis also created a color revolution Facebook group in Ukraine, called Free Hong Kong Center, as shown below.I can't think of two groups that deserve each other more.It became known as the Sunflower Movement and had all the hallmarks of a Western organized and financed color revolution.Flash forward five years.","She explains why Macau's reintegration into the Mainland China has been seamlessly successful.Hong Kong is still a British colony in all but name.Pictured above: I think the Macanese are trying to give Xi Jinping a hint.Here they are with a mock stock market board and Wall-Street-esque gong, to welcome their first bond sold.That hasn't happened yet, but clearly China giving Macau the green light to open a NASDAQ-style stock market is a harbinger to Western color revolution destroyed HK, since the latter has historical bragging rights as Asia's ""Wall Street"".","File photo: Tourists on a beach on Phu Quoc island in southern Vietnam.

The Department of International Relations (Dirco) has confirmed that a South African woman died over the weekend after a rented home she was staying in on Phu Quoc Island off the southern Vietnamese province of Kien Giang caught fire.



Dirco identified the woman as 33-year-old Alana Lens.

""The SA Embassy in Hanoi and Dirco are rendering consular assistance to the family,"" it said.

A website called tuoitrenews.vn reported that police officers said Lens and another woman, believed to be Russian, died when flames engulfed the house following an explosion at around 02:30 on Saturday in Duong Dong Town.

The report said that although the fire was put out within 40 minutes, the house was destroyed.

Five others were hospitalised.

The website said two of the injured people were also foreign.

“Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now”.

~Thomas Jefferson

Everybody is focused on the political arena of entertainment while the framework for a medical tyranny is being built behind the scenes.

Conspiracy and corruption in our medical industry is one of the most stealthy forms of control. Average people just assume that the medical community has our best interests in mind so they don’t scrutinize the information coming from that direction to the same degree.

The white lab coat has been offered as a symbol of unbiased purity. FFS, think about how Monsanto used to be given a wide pass merely because SciEnTiStS dOn’T liE tO uS, aNd MoNsAnTo = sCiEnCe!

Thankfully people are starting to wise up to the whole Monsanto/Bayer debacle and have realized that Monsanto was successfully pulling off unfactual Tobacco $cience for decades. Big victory for humanity!

The problem is, they’re still ignoring a huge fucking elephant in the corner.

The medical system in the USA kills approximately 225,000 people every year. About 106,000 of those people died from drugs they were prescribed.

Did you catch that? About 106,000 people die every year due to following the instructions of their doctor and taking the drugs prescribed to them as directed.

Jon Rappoport points out that the medical community supports and is supported by both sides of the political spectrum and enjoys a type of invisibilty and freedom from scrutiny due to this percieved neutrality. They aren’t “neutral”, though. Their polararity slide can be labeled Government Granted Power vs. The Best Interests of the Populace. They have polarized in one major direction: suckling the teats of government and consolidating power while ignoring the best interests of the populace.

Which is Worse: The NSA or The FDA?

December 30, 2019

By Jon Rappoport

A message to WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other sites that expose secrets.

Does 2.25 million deaths in America, per decade, at the hands of the medical system, rate as a significant leak?

As my readers know, I’ve reported on a number of scandals concerning the toxicity of medical drugs, including shocking death numbers in the US.

These scandals are leaks from inside the National Security State.

If you visit WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other similar sites, how many purely medical documents do you find posted?

How many damaging leaks exposing the crimes of the medical cartel do you find?

Very, very few.

Where are the medical insiders who are liberating and passing along incriminating documentary evidence?

Some of the best exposers of political, intelligence-agency, and military crimes are way behind the curve, when it comes to medical matters.

The medical sphere, for various reasons, is far better protected than any other segment of society.

For the hundredth time, let me cite Dr. Barbara Starfield’s stunning review, “Is US health really the best in the world?” published on July 26, 2000, in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Starfield, at the time, was working as a highly respected public health expert, at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

She concluded that the US medical system kills 225,000 Americans a year. That would add up to 2.25 million deaths per decade.

Laid directly at the door of the American medical complex.

106,000 of those annual deaths, as Starfield reports, are the direct result of medical drugs.

Aside from the genocidal death toll, Starfield’s findings also imply massive fraud in all medical journals that routinely publish glowing results of clinical trials of drugs.

Such trials open the door to the marketing of drugs that kill, according to Starfield, 106,000 Americans every year. How is this possible unless deep, continuing, and abetted research fraud are the order of the day?

Indeed, Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of New England Journal of Medicine for 20 years, wrote the following:

“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” (NY Review of Books, January 15, 2009)

The FDA, of course, is the single government agency responsible for certifying drugs as safe and effective, before their public release is permitted. Yet the FDA takes absolutely no responsibility for the deaths.

Can you imagine the feeding frenzy, if, say, some leaker in the Pentagon passed along a political/military document to Wikileaks that showed the Dept. of Defense was poisoning to death, like clockwork, a hundred thousand of its own soldiers every year?

Let’s stop this insane nonsense of separating one whole set of government crimes from another, simply because the propagandized priests in the white coats are above reproach.

We’re not living in 1950 anymore, and this isn’t Kansas.

In 1988, when I was writing my first book, AIDS INC., I stated that medical covert ops are the most successful methods for pacifying, debilitating, and controlling populations, through toxification, because these ops fly the flag of political neutrality.

They appear to favor no king, dictator, president, government administration or partisan position.

Their propaganda is all about healing and helping.

In fact, the medical cartel is, in the long run, the most effective branch of political repression, from one end of the planet to the other.

It favors top-down control by those in power, whoever they are, whatever they claim to stand for.

Consider this: when Ed Snowden released NSA documents that showed the extent of government surveillance on populations, no one from the intelligence establishment made a serious case that Snowden’s revelations were false. Instead, they attacked Snowden for exposing “methods” of “the war on terror.”

However, in the medical arena, leakers would be afraid that doctors, medical bureaucrats, public health agencies, government leaders, drug-company fronts, and major media outlets would, all at once, deny the validity and truth of the leaks—despite the fact that the truth is there for all to see.

In other words, the best protected cartel in the world—medical—would act in a far more Orwellian fashion. It would say: the truth is not the truth, the facts are not the facts, 2 and 2 do not equal 4—and the cartel would get away with doing that.

This is the kind of clout we’re talking about when it comes to medical matters.

Over the years, I’ve alerted mainstream reporters to the Starfield review, cited above, and other confirming published studies that reveal the horrific extent of medical destruction. Those reporters who bothered to get back to me issued blanket denials. They essentially said, “Yes, I see the evidence and the facts, but the facts aren’t facts. What’s happening isn’t happening.”

Now we’re talking about some heavy brainwashing.

By comparison, it makes the quality of the scandal around Snowden seem like a Sunday lunch in the park.

A few years ago, I had one reporter, who exposes political leaks, tell me: “I don’t mess with medical stuff. It would ruin my credibility.”

Indeed. Another indication of how powerful the medical apparatus is.

Recently, the Washington Post highlighted a new study that puts “medical errors” as the 3rd leading cause of death in America. There hasn’t been any significant follow-up. There hasn’t been an explosion of outrage. So even when exposure occurs, the brainwashing factor is so strong it makes no difference. It’s just another ho-hum day in the news business.

That’s mind control par excellence. That’s tremendous protection of criminals.

That’s like a crime boss saying, “Yeah, I kill 225,000 people every year, but it’s an accident”—and nothing happens.

He goes his merry way, and everyone praises him as a humanitarian.

Talk about inventing and selling false reality.

This one is at the top of the charts, and it stays there.

I could stop here, but I’m going to take this one step further, because, as you can see, I’m talking about mind control. So here is the vital add-on:

American Natural Superfood – Free Sample

From the dawn of history, humans have been particularly vulnerable to statements, from “selfless altruists,” about being saved, being rescued, being given gifts from above. And behind those statements, when there is an organization involved, a top-down organization, the threat level rises considerably.

Leaders have always recognized that if they match their pronouncements and assurances with the population’s unflagging hope of being saved, they, the leaders, win. They win big.

Even in societies where overt human sacrifice was practiced, the cover story involved some kind of healing and rescue. The good gods would see the sacrifices and intervene to produce “better days.” Better life for all.

This is what was sold, and this was what was bought. For many people, the times have not changed. Make them a promise of medical rescue, and they’re in. They’re floating in a hopeful trance.

A hypnotic induction has been performed, and it works.

The controlled subject responds with gratitude.

At that point, you can engage in complete contradictions, rank absurdities, and doublespeak.

The trance will hold.

As my old research collaborator, hypnotherapist Jack True, once told me in an interview, “People want dreams. When they lose faith in their own ability to dream about the life they want, they’ll accept someone else dreaming for them. That’s what hypnosis is. Someone else dreaming for you. You accept a substitute. That’s mind control. That’s believing you can live in someone else’s creation forever…”

If I were the head of an institution of higher learning, I would engrave that quote above the gates, and I would build a four-year course that explores the implications of the quote in every dimension of human existence.

The medical cartel is the best-protected organization on the planet.

Perhaps most notably, new guidelines require two side-by-side columns: one with nutritional information for a single serving, and a second with information for eating the entire package.

Manufacturers that yield less than $10 million in annual food sales will have until 2021 to comply with the new rules.

“We know that Americans are eating differently, and the amount of calories and nutrients on the label is required to reflect what people actually eat and drink,” Claudine Kavanaugh, director of nutrition and food labeling in the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement.

While consumers might not notice a huge change at first glance, Beth Kitchin, an assistant professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s department of nutrition sciences, appreciated the enlarged and emboldened calorie information on the new labels, as well as the new emphasis on serving size.

Serving sizes are based on Americans’ eating habits, determined by the amount people said they consumed in federal food surveys over the past few decades.

With foods that can reasonably be consumed in one sitting, like a pint of ice cream, “the serving size is not what you think it is,” Kitchin said. “It’s a really good change because so many times I’ve talked with consumers who were deceived by that.”

Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, called the new label changes an “important step forward.”

He pointed to the fact that manufacturers are now required to disclose added sugars on labels.

“Because higher added sugar intake has been associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences, it is important to distinguish added sugars from natural sugars in a product,” Hu said.

Consuming too much added sugar has been linked to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Differentiating between naturally occurring and added sugar could also clear up confusion among Americans who think that all sugar is bad for them.

Kitchin said that Americans who are trying to lower their sugar intake sometimes eschew foods like milk, which has naturally occurring sugar, and miss out on nutrients along the way.

“In people’s overexuberance to decrease sugars, they may be decreasing some healthy foods,” she said.

In general, Kitchin hopes the changes will encourage customers to take more interest in reading nutrition labels and prompt them to compare foods’ nutritional information before they buy.

“Hopefully, the information on the new label will not only help consumers make more informed decisions about their food and beverage choices, but also motivate food manufacturers to improve nutritional quality of their products,” Hu added.

The North Korean supreme leader on Thursday expressed his intentions to continue developing new strategic weapons for his nuclear arsenal, according to the country's state media. Hours later, Trump responded by boasting about his relationship with Kim, saying ""he likes me, I like him, we get along.""

""He's representing his country, I'm representing my country, we have to do what we have to do,"" the president added. ""I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out, but I think he's a man of this word.""

After Trump dismissed Kim's threats of more weapons of war, Wendy Sherman—who served as Counselor of the U.S. Department of State, Special Advisor to the President and North Korea Policy Coordinator under the Clinton administration—condemned the president's latest efforts in foreign policy.

""I think what is different here is that Kim Jong Un has played the president like a Stradivarius violin,"" she told MSNBC host Frances Rivera Wednesday. ""He has used the time and the photo-ops to gain credibility internationally, while at the same time gaining time to continue to develop his weapons and indeed probably does have a new strategic weapon, at least on its way to reality.""

Sherman, who's currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, then explained the two most important takeaways from Kim's remarks and the ongoing stalemate over denuclearization.

""One, Kim Jong Un is signaling that he's still open to diplomacy, though what his objectives are is to reduce the sanctions or get rid of them entirely, the president's objective is denuclearization,"" she said.

""Secondly, Kim Jong Un is watching what's happening in the rest of the world with China, in Iraq, with Iran and all of that says to him that the president of the United States is in a much weaker position.""

Kim's announcement of potentially expanding his weapons arsenal comes less than two months after Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the U.S. postponement of a joint military exercise with South Korea as an ""act of goodwill"" to help end nuclear deadlock with North Korea. Esper made the announcement alongside his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, in November, despite warnings from Japan that Kim is unlikely to reciprocate such a gesture.","Donald Trump downplays renewed nuclear threats from North Korea's Kim Jong UnWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump played down rhetorical attacks from Kim Jong Un as the end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without any new nuclear tests in North Korea – but with threats of future ones.

""If the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK (North Korea), there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,"" the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Kim as he announced he no longer feels bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing.

Trump, speaking with reporters at his annual New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, said he still has ""a very good relationship"" with Kim, with whom he has met three times.

""He likes me, I like him, we get along,"" Trump said, adding: ""He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.""

In announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, Kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in North Korea he would unveil a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, the state news agency said. Kim had given the United States an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests.

""The DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,"" the Korean Central News Agency reported Kim as saying.

Trump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday – a North Korea official had threatened a ""Christmas gift"" to the U.S. – but nothing had happened as midnight passed in North Korea.

In speaking with reporters, Trump joked that he hoped Kim's ""Christmas present"" was ""a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else.""

Trump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with North Korea, though critics say Kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in June of 2018. The two men also met in 2019 in Vietnam and at the North Korea-South Korea border.

While Trump often cites the Singapore agreement as a hopeful sign, critics pointed out that it was nonspecific and nonbinding when it came to North Korea giving up nuclear weapons.

""Kim signed nothing binding regarding nukes or missiles. No Kim ever has,"" tweeted Robert E. Kelly, professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea.

He added: ""And Republicans used to know that the Kims shouldn’t be trusted. But now the GOP’s a cult of personality, right?

Madison County Editor

Since its introduction 47 years ago, the Metro Parks Winter Hike Series has morphed into a massive event.

Thousands of people now show up for the hikes which take place in January and February at 13 of the system’s 19 parks. Participants are treated to guided and self-guided hikes, hot chocolate and soup, and the fellowship of like-minded winter adventurers.

But with all that good stuff comes lots of discarded bowls, spoon and cups, and carbon emissions from cars carrying those adventurers to and from the parks.

While Metro Parks is thrilled that so many people have latched onto the hike series, they also want to be good stewards of the environment.

“We’re happy to provide the experience, but we also don’t want to make a mess of this world,” said Jill Snyder, assistant manager of education and interpretation.

To that end, Metro Parks started a few years ago to encourage participants to carpool to the hikes and bring their own reusable mugs and bowls. Hikers also can earn commemorative mugs by donating five cans of food, five personal hygeine items, or $5 to the Mid Ohio Food Bank.

This year, the park system is ramping up its conservation efforts even more.

“We’re really trying to reduce waste from the event,” Snyder said.

To do that, Metro Parks is using compostable bowls and utensils where possible in place of styrofoam and plastic. They have partnered with The Compost Exchange, which will compost refuse and food waste from the hikes, as well as educate hikers about composting. In addition to the mugs hikers can earn with food bank donations, the Friends of the Metro Parks are selling reusable bowls and spoons.

“We hope to divert a whole lot of trash from the landfill,” Snyder said.

Metro Parks staffers plan to track just how much waste they divert.

“If we hit certain goals, we’re going to save the turtles–not sea turtles, but our own Ohio turtles,” Snyder said.

The idea is to provide better habitat and resources for protection of turtles, especially box turtles, whose numbers are declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation. (Turtles are getting hit on roads, including those within the parks, that bisect their living areas.) Additionally, a new nature center planned for Blacklick Woods Metro Park in Reynoldsburg will include an educational component on turtles.

So, what do turtles have to do with waste reduction?

“Sometimes, it’s hard to get people excited about trash… This way, we’re saying that if we can get everyone on board with our conservation efforts, we as a Metro Park district will give back to protecting the environment,” Snyder said.

This year’s motto for the Winter Hike Series is “Hike to a Greener Place.” For more information, go to metroparks.net.

It will, therefore, have a chance to showcase its full potential by hosting 90 million passengers, a figure it can handle in the initial phase of development.



Already seen as the new center of aviation rising from the outskirts of Turkey's most populous city, perched firmly on the shores of the Black Sea, the airport was officially opened in a grand ceremony on Oct. 29, 2018, coinciding with the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Two days later, Turkish Airlines flight TK214 took off for the capital Ankara as the first aircraft to leave the airport.



However, its first phase became fully operational on April 7, as it took over the air traffic from the now-closed Atatürk Airport. The civil aviation adventure undertaken at Atatürk Airport, which was commissioned in 1953, said goodbye with the pride of having accomplished its mission successfully. It was one of the busiest airports in Europe. The airport has transitioned to other uses such as training activities, aviation fairs and civil use, while some parts are to be transformed into a public park.



GREATEST LOGISTIC OPERATION



The transfer from Atatürk Airport was a success story in its own right. In what was said to be the greatest logistic operation in civil aviation history, thousands of tons of equipment, from huge aircraft-towing vehicles to extremely sensitive materials, were ferried across the city. Trucks carried equipment a total distance of 400,000 kilometers, an equivalent of going 10 times around the world. Over 1,800 personnel were employed during the operation.



Scheduled to last 45 hours, the operation was completed in a record time of 33 hours. It began in the early hours of April 5, 2019, and was completed on April 6, 2019, in the afternoon.



The airport – a pinpoint megaproject by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) – was initially launched over a need for meeting the ever-growing demand from around the world, relieving air traffic with a strong infrastructure and large capacity.



Completed in 42 months, the first phase of the airport was built with a cost of 6 billion euros ($6.72 billion) with a public-private partnership (PPP) model by a consortium of Turkey's leading contractors Limak, Kolin, Cengiz, Mapa and Kalyon. The consortium will pay 1.1 billion euros annually for 25 years. The project represents a total economic size of 32.4 billion euros, excluding taxes. This figure constitutes an investment cost of 10.2 billion euros and 22.2 billion euros for rental costs to be paid to the government.



Before its establishment, there were two airports in one of the world's most crowded cities, Sabiha Gökçen Airport on Istanbul's Anatolian side and Atatürk Airport on the European side. Atatürk Airport served some 68 million passengers in 2018, its last year, while Sabiha Gökçen has a current capacity to welcome some 31 million passengers a year.



The new airport can handle 90 million passengers a year in the current phase of development, which, while it is a high figure, is nothing compared to its potential capacity to serve 200 million after the completion of all phases.



It served some 40.47 million passengers in its first year, while it reached its 50 millionth passenger on Dec. 23.



Once fully operational, it will be the world's largest in terms of the number of passengers. All four phases of the airport's construction and expansion, including six runways, are expected to be completed by 2028.



Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Cahit Turhan in October said the construction of the third parallel runway at the airport in the area of 76.5 million square meters located on the coast of the Black Sea between Yeniköy and Akpınar regions was nearing an end.



He said the runway is expected to be put into service in the summer of 2020 and with the opening of the runway, the Triple Parallel Runway Operation used in just a few airports in the world will be implemented.



An east-west runway and a parallel taxiway will also be built in the second stage. The second terminal building of approximately 450,000 square meters will be put into service when the number of passengers reaches 80 million and an additional parallel runway with parallel taxiways and an additional apron are said to be used in this process.



When the number of passengers reaches 110 million, a new satellite terminal of 170,000 square meters is planned to be put into service at the end of the fourth stage.



The airport will eventually be able to host more than 100 airlines and operate 3,500 flights per day to about 350 destinations worldwide, making the city an aviation hub that has already seen an increasing demand thanks to its strategic location and as being a center for connecting flights.



ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AVIATION CENTER



The Istanbul Airport project is not only drawing attention as a travel hub. It also contains and uses state-of-the-art technology and has earned a reputation for its environmental awareness policies in line with international standards.



The airport's terminal building, which has continued to improve its sustainability since the design phase, was built to provide 24% more energy efficiency and 40% more water efficiency than conventional systems. Moreover, within the ""Climate Change Adaptation and Action Plan,"" the airport has been adapted to climate change.



One policy implemented in the airport to create an environmentally friendly workplace for operators and businesses is the waste sorting system. This policy was part of the Zero Waste Declaration signed by the CEOs of 18 main stakeholders under the leadership of the airport's operator IGA. Accordingly, the waste is divided into five categories, paper/cardboard, packaging, glass, organic and domestic waste, allowing for proper recycling.



A GLOBAL HUB BETWEEN ASIA, AFRICA AND EUROPE



Istanbul Airport has already won several international awards, including the International Airport Reviews' (IAR) ""Readers' Choice: Airport of the Year"" award. The editor of the U.K.-based magazine, Tara Nolan, pointed out that the new airport in Istanbul serves ""as a global hub between Asia, Africa and Europe.""



The award was given to Istanbul Airport from among several other popular international airports, including London Heathrow Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Canada's Vancouver Airport, Australia's Sydney Airport and Hong Kong International Airport.



The airport was also awarded during the Dec. 16-18, 2016 World Architecture Festival held in Berlin for the design of its terminal building under the category of ""Upcoming Projects- Infrastructure."" The terminal building is the world's largest terminal building with a single roof.



The flight control tower of the newly inaugurated airport was also awarded by Chicago Athenaeum with the 2016 International Architecture Award.","Turkish Airlines expands fleet, opens 4 new routes in 2020In 2020, Turkish Airlines will expand and update its fleet, opening four new flight paths, according to the chairman of Turkey's flag carrier.



""We have completed all the necessary procedures to launch flights to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Newark, New Jersey, and Vancouver, Canada in 2019,"" said İlker Aycı, adding that now they are just waiting for the required permits. Besides the latest batch of new destinations, he said the airline would also focus on frequency depth.

After launching services to 10 new international routes in 2019, the carrier closed the year with a flight network including 318 cities across 126 countries, Aycı noted.

Recalling the airlines' switch from Atatürk Airport to Istanbul's new mega-airport as the company's biggest move in 2019, Aycı said: ""Turkish Airlines has to have a strong infrastructure, one supporting its growth, in order to achieve its goals without interruption.""

Istanbul Airport, the ""World's New Hub,"" officially opened on Oct. 29, 2018, the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. With the capacity to serve some 200 million passengers per year and with all four phases and six runways to be completed by 2028, Istanbul Airport is set to become a global aviation hub home to more than 100 airlines flying to over 300 destinations around the world.

Underlining that the airline had reached full capacity shortly after moving to the mega-airport, Aycı said: ""Our new home knocked both ourselves and our customers out of the usual routine, but here we learned to walk again, putting aside all our old assumptions.""

While Atatürk Airport fell short of responding to Turkish Airlines' need for more slots and capacity due to constraints such as runway insufficiency, the company now presides over a larger operational space thanks to Istanbul Airport, Aycı said. ""The third runway to open at Istanbul Airport in 2020 will ease the traffic density,"" Aycı added. When the third runway goes live, it will be possible to do an aircraft landing and takeoff every 43 seconds, or more than 2,000 planes a day, he added.

Turkish Airlines is continuing to expand its fleet with next-generation aircraft while replacing older models, Aycı said. By the end of 2019, the airline had 351 aircraft, including 98 wide-body, 229 narrow-body and 24 cargo planes, up from 332 at the beginning of the year. ""With our current fleet size, we rank 10th among the passenger airlines globally,"" Aycı said. ""Among the top 10, we have the fourth-youngest fleet."" He added that 28 more aircraft will be added to the fleet in 2020, stressing that the company is open to rental options.

Capacity rising

Despite having to ground Boeing 737 Max aircraft and a delay in the delivery of the A321 Neo aircraft, Turkish Airlines posted a 2.7% rise in its capacity between January and November 2019, Aycı noted. This came despite 12 planes from the fleet being grounded and 12 more aircraft's delivery being delayed, he explained.

Boeing's top-selling 737 Max was grounded worldwide after crashes which killed hundreds of people and cost the company billions of dollars. On Tuesday, Turkish Airlines announced that Boeing had agreed to compensate it for losses caused by the grounded and undelivered planes. ""Boeing will cover some of our losses and the revenue that we cannot generate because of aircraft being grounded and out of use,"" the carrier said in a statement.

In the first 11 months of 2019, the flag carrier served 68.8 million passengers. ""Despite an 11.5% contraction in the domestic market in Turkey, we welcomed 28.3 million passengers taking domestic flights, boosting our market share by 2.5 points,"" Aycı said. The number of passengers carried on international flights rose 3.5% to 40.4 million, he underlined.

Turkish Airlines has 15 subsidiaries and joint ventures including Turkish Technic, Turkish Cargo, Turkish Ground Services, Turkish Opet Aviation Fuels and Sun Express. Touching on Turkish Cargo's operations, Aycı said the company had kept growing despite the global air cargo sector shrinking by 3.5%.

""Despite these unfavorable market conditions and having to carry out our cargo operations at two different airports, we posted an increase of 9.5% in cargo volume to 1.4 million tons,"" Aycı stressed. Turkish Cargo posted an impressive $452 million in revenue in the first three quarters, he added.","The civil aviation adventure undertaken at Atatürk Airport, which was commissioned in 1953, said goodbye with the pride of having accomplished its mission successfully.The airport has transitioned to other uses such as training activities, aviation fairs and civil use, while some parts are to be transformed into a public park.Completed in 42 months, the first phase of the airport was built with a cost of 6 billion euros ($6.72 billion) with a public-private partnership (PPP) model by a consortium of Turkey's leading contractors Limak, Kolin, Cengiz, Mapa and Kalyon.Atatürk Airport served some 68 million passengers in 2018, its last year, while Sabiha Gökçen has a current capacity to welcome some 31 million passengers a year.Accordingly, the waste is divided into five categories, paper/cardboard, packaging, glass, organic and domestic waste, allowing for proper recycling.","""We have completed all the necessary procedures to launch flights to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Newark, New Jersey, and Vancouver, Canada in 2019,"" said İlker Aycı, adding that now they are just waiting for the required permits.By the end of 2019, the airline had 351 aircraft, including 98 wide-body, 229 narrow-body and 24 cargo planes, up from 332 at the beginning of the year.""With our current fleet size, we rank 10th among the passenger airlines globally,"" Aycı said.He added that 28 more aircraft will be added to the fleet in 2020, stressing that the company is open to rental options.On Tuesday, Turkish Airlines announced that Boeing had agreed to compensate it for losses caused by the grounded and undelivered planes.","<s> The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Rt.

Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has called for a ""new beginning"" as talks to restore power-sharing resume tomorrow at Stormont.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party aimed to secure a ""fair and balanced"" deal.

The parties have just 11 days to reach a compromise. Secretary of State Julian Smith has warned that he will call a fresh Assembly election if an agreement hasn't been brokered by then.

Mr Smith will hold bilateral meetings with the parties before a round-table discussion at Stormont House.

Mr Coveney yesterday urged Northern Ireland politicians to show leadership and generosity in the negotiations.

He said the new year offered a chance for a fresh beginning and he urged all sides not to disappoint the public again. The dialogue had been paused for the Christmas holidays.

As of Jan. 1, 2020, Washington drivers will no longer take an emissions test to renew their registration.

The emissions program is ending based on a plan passed in the state Legislature in 2005. The Washington Department of Ecology had projected that Washington's air quality would improve enough by 2020 to end the program, which started in 1982.

Five counties currently require emissions testing: Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties.

Last year, approximately 750,000 vehicles required testing. That number is down from 1.2 million a few years prior.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, the manager of the Air Quality program for the Washington Department of Ecology. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Officials stress this verdict will not hinder Washington’s fight against climate change, which focused on carbon monoxide emissions.

Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that face a greater threat to the environment were not tested.

Vehicles remain the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington. Supporting zero-emission vehicles through Washington’s clean car standards and advocating for public transit are among ways state officials have been addressing the ongoing problem of pollution.

Ending the program will affect about 180 people who work for Applus, the contractor that operates testing stations. About a dozen employees at the Department of Ecology and several independent testing and repair stations will be impacted by the program's end.

Administrators have been working with the employees to prepare for the shutdown and help them find other positions.

EVERETT — The dread of driving a clunker to an emissions test — and maybe facing an expensive fix — is over.

After 38 years, Tuesday is the final day vehicles must be analyzed for carbon monoxide spewing from the exhaust pipe. The $15 tests were required in regions covering most of Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish and Spokane counties. Failing a test meant getting exhaust system repairs, although that requirement was waived if the cost exceeded $150.

Stricter emission standards for new cars and trucks, enacted by the Legislature, took effect in 2008. Vehicles newer than the 2009 model year were excluded from testing, as were vehicles older than 25 years. The law created an ever-shrinking number of vehicles that were required to be tested.

At the height of Washington’s testing program in 2011, nearly 1.3 million vehicles got emissions checks. In 2017, just 12% of all licensed vehicles in the state were checked. Last year, about 750,000 tests were conducted.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, manager of the Washington Department of Ecology air quality program, in a news release. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Given the trend of cleaner engines and stricter emission requirements for new vehicles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency became convinced that air quality was not likely to deteriorate. Washington will continue monitoring air quality and must prove it will improve without emissions testing.

“If we see consistent high levels of air pollution, we are required under both the state and federal clean air acts to come up with a plan to reduce pollution and protect air quality,” said Andrew Wineke, a spokesman for the state Department of Ecology’s air quality program.

The end of emissions testing also means the end of a niche industry in Washington. About 180 people work for Applus, which operated testing stations, including in Everett, Marysville and Lynnwood. Another dozen Ecology employees will be affected by the program closing. The company and the state office worked with those employees to prepare for the shutdown.

When the EPA enacted air quality standards, it was to improve human health. Fine particulates, such as from forest fires, fossil fuel combustion or tree pollen, can aggravate respiratory and cardiovascular disease, reduce lung function and might be linked to lung cancer, according to the EPA.

“When we started the emission check program, parts of our state were threatened by high levels of carbon monoxide, ozone and particulate pollution — with levels sometimes above federal standards,” Wineke said. “Today, every part of Washington meets federal air quality standards.”

Washington’s emissions testing program started in 1982 with six test sites in King and Snohomish counties.

In 1980, the EPA’s air quality index included 11 days that were deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups and four days of air unhealthy for the whole population.

To date this year, Snohomish County has had 233 good days, 39 days with moderate air quality, one unhealthy day for sensitive groups and no generally unhealthy or very unhealthy days. The remaining days had particulate levels too small to measure.

A 1990 federal clean air law made emissions testing mandatory and resulted in the addition of testing facilities in 1993 for urbanized areas that weren’t meeting standards.

Starting in 2002, technicians plugged into a computer’s on-board diagnostics port to get a reading for most cars. That led to issues with Volkswagen vehicles equipped with 2- and 3-liter diesel engines that had emission-cheating devices which violated federal and state Clean Air Acts.

The settlement with the German auto company helped pay for electric buses in the Mukilteo, Snohomish and Stanwood-Camano school districts, and Everett Transit.

Washington’s climate won’t be affected much by the end of emissions testing. The program’s aim was to reduce toxics in the form of pollution like carbon monoxide, whereas carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of climate change.

“Vehicles are still the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington — accounting for about 45% of our total emissions,” Wineke said.

The snag with online justice is that in a case like this you never know whether the masses want him punished for a) whacking a fox, b) being anti-Brexit, or c) being a barrister.

What we do know is that when animals are involved, all sense of proportion vanishes. I recall some years ago a reader suggesting a suitable punishment for a defendant who had killed a dog. It began with using an industrial sander to flay him alive and then rolling him in rock salt before putting him out of his agony with a bullet. Another reader took the view that a bullet was far too merciful.

If there is a lesson to learn from this backyard drama it is that we live in an age when if you really must kill an animal, no matter what the circumstances, it is probably wise to keep quiet about it. Especially if you have a name like Jolyon.","'I've been able to adjust and find a way': Peter Siddle speaks about his cricketing career post-retirementAustralia speedster Peter Siddle has expressed his thoughts on how he wanted to bid goodbye to international cricket earlier in the year.

Siddle has announced his retirement from cricket on Sunday (December 29) and later on while speaking to ESPNcricinfo, the fast-bowler claimed how he wanted to retire right after the Ashes Series.

Siddle's final appearances in Test cricket for the kangaroos was during the 2019 Ashes series. However, he was told by the country's cricketing board to put a hold to his retirement plans.

""JL, Painey and I, we chatted about it early on in the Ashes series, there was a possibility (of finishing in England) ""But there was a bit of back-and-forth about the chances of maybe being able to do it back home if things fall into place,"" Siddle said.

""I was pretty content to do it over there, but that small, little hope that maybe I might get a chance back in Australia in front of family and friends, I was happy to take the gamble and see if it happened.""

Since making his Test debut against India in 2008, Siddle earned 67 caps for the Aussies in the longest format of the game and picked up 221 wickets with an average of 30.6.

""Obviously it didn't, but very content with the career I've had. As a young kid, I never thought I'd play one, let alone play 67, so very happy.""

""I've played 180 first-class games, so the longevity to be able to play long-form cricket over that short time, it's all about keeping the body right, maintaining a healthy body and doing everything you can to adjust throughout those years,"" he added.

The pacer successfully made his comeback into the national side in 2018 during Australia's series against Pakistan, after he missed a year of cricket in 2016.

en,en,1484201854_1484199265,1,1.4,1,1.6,1.4,2.2,1.6,"Austrian Conservatives, Greens Strike Coalition DealVIENNA - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz struck a coalition deal on Wednesday with the Greens to ensure his return to power and bring the left-wing party into government for the first time, three months after Kurz won a parliamentary election.

The deal marked a swing left for Kurz, whose last coalition was with the far-right Freedom Party. It also means Austria will join fellow European Union member states Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government, albeit in a junior role, at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.

After a final round of coalition talks on New Year's Day and two days of leaks of new Cabinet members' names, Kurz and his Greens counterpart said they had struck a deal, as widely expected.

They held off, however, on providing details of their plans. Those will be presented to the public Thursday.

""We have reached an agreement,"" Kurz told reporters standing next to Greens leader Werner Kogler.

The two will become chancellor and vice chancellor of the new government, and the Greens will control just four of 15 ministries, roughly reflecting their performance in the September 29 election, which Kurz's People's Party won with 37.5% of the vote. The Greens came in fourth with 13.9%.

""It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologize the tax system,"" Kurz said, referring to core campaign pledges of each party and hinting at the deal's contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.","Austria’s Conservatives and Greens agree on coalition governmentAustria's Conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday agreed to form a coalition government with the Greens after a final round of talks capping almost three months of negotiations.

It will mark the first time the Green party has been in power, after Kurz's alliance with the far-right collapsed in a corruption scandal and triggered elections in September.

Kurz's People's Party (OeVP) and the Greens made gains in the election, bringing them together in unlikely negotiations given the 33-year-old's carefully groomed image as a hardliner on immigration.

""The OeVP and Greens have agreed on a government programme together,"" a Greens representative with knowledge of the negotiations, who declined to be named, told AFP.

An OeVP official confirmed the same to AFP. The two parties' leaders are to make a statement later Wednesday.

'Huge stretch'

Despite progress to bridge the significant gaps, observers said the new government would face challenges after Kurz's previous rule with the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) saw a raft of anti-immigration measures passed, sharply dividing Austrians.

""2020 as a political year of change"" ran the main online headline of the Kurier daily earlier Wednesday.

Both the OeVP and the Greens will be hard-pressed to show they have not compromised too much on their key principals and campaign promises when they present the joint government programme, which is expected Thursday.

""From his (Kurz's) perspective, it's a huge stretch and it's also a danger that over time he might lose some of the voters he gained from the Freedom Party,"" analyst Thomas Hofer told AFP.

In the September polls, the OeVP managed to pick up disenchanted FPOe voters, getting 37.5 percent in total.

The Greens secured 13.9 percent of the vote, their best-ever result, due to the environment replacing immigration as top concern in the country of 8.8 million people.

Trend setter?

Hofer said other European countries, such as Germany, could also see Conservative-Green party coalitions in the future. Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Luxemburg already have Greens in government.

""Kurz is setting a certain trend maybe ahead of time, and this is certainly something also on the international stage that he would be able to sell,"" he said.

Hofer described Greens chief Werner Kogler, who is expected to be vice-chancellor, as a ""pragmatist"" who had stabilised the party.

The 58-year-old took on the leadership after the party lost all their parliamentary seats in a shock defeat in 2017, largely due to infighting and splits.

A congress of the party's almost 280 delegates must still endorse the coalition agreement, but they are expected to do so.

""It's a historical chance for them,"" Hofer said.

As junior coalition partner, the Greens would get four ministries, including an enlarged environment ministry that also comprises infrastructure, traffic, energy and technology, according to a party representative familiar with the negotiations.

The OeVP will maintain control of the rest, including the coveted interior ministry -- previously headed by a far-right official and embroiled in scandal -- and the finance portfolio.

Greens official Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic told the Standard daily in an interview that compromises are ""part of democracy"", and that the coalition partners would address challenges rather than ""feign harmony and sweep difficult topics under the carpet"".

The far-right FPOe -- previously riding a wave of populist sentiment seen across Europe -- was routed in the polls after the so-called ""Ibiza-gate"" graft scandal brought down their then-leader and vice-chancellor in May and caused the government to collapse.

Combine this with excellent consumer confidence levels and extraordinarily low unemployment numbers, and it makes for a lot of companies with cash on their hands.

It should be a great season for bonuses, but these strong cash positions also create an opportunity for growth. In fact, if you fail to leverage these good times to grow your business, you’ll be in a much weaker position when the next inevitable downturn hits the economy.

Create successful growth through diversification

With the knowledge that a downturn will eventually hit, let’s look at diversification as an overall guiding principle when we consider growth strategies. When you diversify, it’s not only growing your business, it’s taking out an insurance policy that protects you for when business slows.

Diversification is important for your personal investment portfolio; it’s important for your business for similar reasons. Here are some ways you can bring diversity to your business model:

Add new products and services to your catalog

Target different customer groups

Buy related companies

Establish your business in new geographic areas

Expand overseas

Expand your offerings

I’m sure you’ve asked yourself the question “What else can I sell to my customers?” If you’ve had ideas along these lines, but haven’t yet followed through on them, there probably won’t be a better time than now, so take action.

Also, consider these strategies:

Create product or service levels, then as time goes on, add attractive features to the higher-priced levels, encouraging customers to upgrade.

Bundle your products and services. Have you ever watched the TV show American Pickers? When they want to make a purchase from a reluctant seller, they “bundle” a few items together. Bundling items makes deals more attractive to both buyer and seller.

Target untapped consumers

It’s a fact of life that, over the last decade or two, the United States has become much more of a salad bowl than a melting pot, and you can analyze this from a variety of angles. We have a wide range of language and ethnic groups that tend to maintain their identities, and we also have the East and West Coasts versus the “flyover” states. I might also mention that we have an extreme diversity in age cohorts, like the baby boomers, millennials, Gen-Xers, Generation Z, and more to come!

Who are your current typical customers? How can your product or service be tweaked to make inroads into other groups of consumers? Let’s take Spanish-speaking consumers as an example. If you watch any of the sports channels, you’ll notice that even on the English-language broadcasts they promote their Spanish-language channels. They know that although Spanish-speaking sports fans are watching their English broadcasts, if they can move them to their Spanish channel, they will create a more loyal and avid viewer.

Grow through acquisitions

There are two basic ways to go here: acquire competitors or acquire suppliers. A third strategy might be to acquire companies that are somewhat related to your industry or share a customer base.

A good thing about acquiring one or more of your suppliers (vertical integration) is that your competitors probably use the same suppliers. If your competitors continue to buy from the companies you acquire, you’re getting a bit of their sales. If your competitors move to different suppliers, you’ve made life a little more difficult for them.

Expand domestically

Remember the Great Recession? It would have been far worse had it not been for Texas, which continued to grow through much of the Great Recession while every other state was still struggling.

There are major population migration streams between states right now, which strongly impacts certain urban areas through loss of residents and a boom in residents. With apologies to the cities that made the shrinking list, these demographics represent bandwagons to jump on and sinking ships to abandon, at least when you’re devising plans to grow your business.

Expand overseas

With the advent of the internet and convenient international shipping, expanding into foreign markets is easier now than it has ever been. A musician friend of mine was telling me recently how he bought a piece of gear from a seller in Australia, and how a friend of his who owns a music store has done a great job selling to overseas buyers.

The benefits are many: Not only can you realize new revenue, you can connect to new talent, discover foreign investment opportunities, boost your reputation, and more.

At some point, you’ll need to deal with various currencies, and fortunately there’s been an explosion in online Forex broker sites. That’s good, but it can also be confusing. It’s smart to start your Forex broker search at an overview site where you can customize filters like the one found on FX-List.com; you’ll save yourself some time.

There’s also a lot of information available from the government to help you get started selling overseas. Check out the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council and Export.gov. Sometimes the best initial strategy is to partner with an existing foreign company or find a distributor so you can more easily get your foot in the door.

We started this by noting the positive business climate that we’re currently enjoying. If you work hard now to expand, there’s a good chance you can continue to ride this wave for quite some time.

The year 2020 isn’t just a new year; it also marks the end of a decade and the beginning of another consequential one. The next decade will have a monumental impact on all the facets of our lives, including our finances. We need to set clear plans and execute them to perfection to extract the most out of the next 10 years and accelerate our journey to achieve financial freedom. With drastic changes in cost of living expected in the next decade, how should you manage your money and what are the financial tips you should follow? We have some pointers.

Identify long-term financial goals

Correctly identifying your long-term financial goals is very important as you step into the new decade. So, whether you are in college, in a job or close to retirement, you need to identify your goals carefully. For example, college-going individuals of today would be starting a career in the coming decade, so they should prioritise repaying their education loan, building a contingency fund, saving money for their future, getting a life insurance policy and focusing on buying a car or house.

Similarly, people who are in the middle of their careers should focus on goals such as to repay their home loan quickly, stay adequately insured, and build up a fund for their children’s future. And those about to retire should focus on the financial goals pertaining to becoming debt-free and retiring with an adequate corpus which can help them maintain the same standard of living when their income sources deplete.

Invest keeping inflation in mind

The average inflation in the last decade had been lower than the inflation in the decade previous to that. In the next decade, the average inflation is expected to remain slightly lower than this decade. So, the rates in fixed interest instruments like PPF, bank FDs, etc., are expected to fall. The equity market is expected to become more stable and robust. So, while investing your money, you should factor in the impact of inflation on the returns. Diversify your portfolio adequately and take investment risk strictly as per your risk appetite. You may invest in instruments like PPF, NPS, mutual funds, sovereign gold bonds, ETFs, etc.

The emergency fund plays a vital role in boosting your confidence during an adverse situation. So, whether you are young, in the middle of your career or a retiree, keep an emergency fund worth at least six months of your expenses to take on any kind of financial distress. Keep increasing the size of the emergency fund as your cost of living and responsibilities change in the future.

Fine-tune your insurance plans

Depending on your age and career stage, you should start or increase your crucial insurance plans. If you would start a career in the coming decade, you should get life and health insurance policy with adequate risk cover. However, if you already have these policies, you should fine-tune your insurance policies. Medical inflation is highest in comparison to other forms of inflation, so it’s important to stay adequately insured and avoid big expenses related to hospitalisation. Similarly, you should be ready to save dependent family members from financial hardship by getting a life insurance cover of at least 10 to 20 times your current annual income.

Rent or buy a house? Make your choice

Housing is going to be a big challenge in the next decade because the land bank is limited, and with a growing population, property demand is expected to increase substantially. So, make your choice now, whether you would be comfortable living in a rented home or would like to buy a home. In either case, make it a goal and start channelising your savings and investment returns to achieve your goal on time.

Plan for your children’s higher education

Higher education costs have seen a major spike in the current decade and things are unlikely to change in the next one too. So, plan to raise an adequate fund for your kid’s education as early as possible in your career so that you can avoid taking a loan at the end of your career. Set a separate financial goal to that end and consider regular investments in tools like PPF, SSY, SIPs, etc.

The author is CEO, BankBazaar.com","Buying a life insurance policy? Check the claim settlement ratio of the insurer first; Here’s whyWhat are the things you should look at while buying a Life insurance policy?

The need for life insurance is to get financial security in case something happens to the policyholder. While buying a life insurance policy, most look at the premium they need to pay and choose an insurance policy. However, that’s where most policyholders make the mistake – the moment of truth for a life insurance company is at the time of settling a claim.

The claim settlement ratio of a company is an indicator of the number of claims they have settled over the intimations received by the insurance company. Yusuf Pachmariwala, Executive Vice President and Head of Operations, Tata AIA Life Insurance, says “The claim settlement ratio reveals the percentage of claims the insurer has paid out during a financial year. Hence, the higher the ratio, the more confidence consumers will have on the life insurer while buying a policy, as it is reflective of the company’s commitment to its consumers.”

The claim settlement ratio reflects the overall risk management ability of the insurer. It demonstrates how efficiently the insurer has implemented the necessary technology and process to weed out applications that are not genuine. “Pure protection policies (where there’s no savings component) are more prone to frauds and consequently have a lower settlement ratio,” says an HDFC Life Spokesperson’. Hence, while comparing claim settlement ratios across insurance companies, pay attention to the experience of the insurer, the book size, product mix, and portfolio vintage.

Note that, low pending claim ratio indicates the efficiency of the life insurer, indicting how quickly it decides on the claims it received during the financial year. At the same time, while purchasing life insurance, policyholders should also look at factors other than claim settlement ratios, such as brand, financial robustness of the insurer, product suitability, governance standards, and superior customer service.

What are the things you should look at while buying a Life insurance policy?

As a policyholder, there are various criteria you should look at before opting for an insurance policy. Note that, the product chosen should also meet your financial goals. Pachmariwala, of Tata AIA Life Insurance, says “The process of buying a life insurance policy should start with an assessment of one’s protection need. As a rule of thumb, one should have 10 to 15 times of annual income, depending on one’s age, as their life insurance cover. Having decided on the amount of adequate life cover, one should decide on the kind of product and product features one wants.”

Requirements and needs of every individual keep changing as per the changing life stages of the policyholder – such as planning to purchase a home, children’s education, retirement planning, etc. It is imperative to ensure that the insurance policy you choose adequately compensates for the income loss keeping in mind factors like future income, changing interest rates, rising costs, etc.

First-time life insurance buyer, should consider buying a Term plan. These policies offer larger financial cover at a low-value premium, especially, if bought, in the early earning phase of the policyholder’s life span. There are additional benefits and features including coverage till a very high age which some insurers offer.

From a premium paying perspective, if the choice is that of a regular paying product, policyholders should plan and space premium payments such that continuity of the policy is maintained. Lapsation of policies leads to loss of benefits and life cover for the policyholder and the beneficiaries.","In the next decade, the average inflation is expected to remain slightly lower than this decade.Keep increasing the size of the emergency fund as your cost of living and responsibilities change in the future.Make your choice

Russian state media sounded a triumphal tone in the December 27th announcement that the first Avangards are now ready for launch, even specifying the exact hour of combat readiness for the nuclear-armed hypersonic glider.

“The Avangard strategic missile system has been put on combat duty at 10 a.m. today,” Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin. The weapon was deployed with a missile division in the Orenburg region 900 miles southeast of Moscow.

Avangard is a nuclear-armed boost-glide system. The glider is boosted high into the atmosphere atop a Sarmat ICBM, and then glides down to its target at what Russia claims is a speed of Mach 27. The weapon was spurred by Moscow’s fears that the U.S. missile defense program will eventually be capable of intercepting and destroying conventional Russian ICBMs, and thus encourage America to launch a first strike without fear of Russian nuclear retaliation. But while conventional ICBM warheads descend from space at Mach 20-plus, they follow predictable ballistic trajectories: a winged hypersonic glider can maneuver within the atmosphere to avoid interception.

Putin “has the Avangard’s ability to evade U.S. missile defense systems,” noted the Moscow Times. “Russia said it showed the missile system to U.S. inspectors last month as part of a bilateral arms control treaty ahead of its deployment.”

“Officials say the ICBM flies 27 times faster than the speed of sound. During the last known tests that took place in December 2018, the Avangard hit a practice target 6,000 kilometers [3,728 miles] away.”

Putin recently claimed that “this weapon of the future can penetrate both existing and any future missile defense systems.” Other Russian hypersonic weapons include the nuclear-armed Khinzal air-launched missile, and the Zircon anti-ship missile.

Interestingly, Putin also described Russia being the first nation to deploy hypersonic missiles as being “a unique situation in our contemporary history where they’re trying to catch up.” Which suggests that Putin considers it the norm for Russia to be trying to catch up in the arms race.

From Germany’s Adolf Hitler to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to Chinese leader Mao Zedong (毛澤東), the world’s 20th-century dictators took to heart Niccolo Machiavelli’s famous dictum that “it is better to be feared than loved.”

Yet, most modern dictators seem more concerned about maintaining their people’s loyalty not by giving them what they want, but by manipulating them into thinking that they already have it. Nobody executes this approach more masterfully than Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Although Putin’s approval ratings have declined considerably over the past few years, they remain high, with polls indicating that 61 percent of Russians evaluate his performance positively.

If a presidential election were held today, 44 percent would vote for Putin. No other candidate would receive double-digit percentage support.

Putin certainly does not owe his popularity to his economic leadership. Since recapturing the presidency in 2012, he has consistently failed to deliver on promises of reform, higher productivity and investment, and improvements in Russians’ standard of living. His government also does not seem to have any plan to kick-start stagnant GDP growth.

The IMF expects Russia’s annual GDP growth to average less than 2 percent over the next five years. Next year, Russia’s share of global GDP (in purchasing parity terms) is expected to drop below 3 percent for the first time in modern times.

In nominal terms, this ratio will be even lower: an estimated 1.8 percent. Most importantly, the real incomes of Russian households are 10 percent lower than they were in 2014 — and show no signs of rising.

So what explains Putin’s enduring popularity? The answer — for Putin and other modern autocrats — lies in the ability to control the information that people receive, which enables a leader to convince most of the population that, despite the regime’s imperfections, it is the country’s best option.

In the digital age, this is no easy feat. A growing number of educated citizens — or “informed elites” — recognize the system’s deficiencies. It is thus imperative for autocrats to prevent these elites from communicating the truth to the public.

TARGETED REPRESSION

Repression plays an important role here. However, far from the widely publicized mass repression of the past — aimed at scaring off all potential opposition — today’s repression is targeted and, critically, deniable.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was officially barred from running in the 2018 presidential election not for political reasons, but because of his fraud conviction, which was subsequently overturned by the European Court of Human Rights.

This approach enabled Putin to maintain the pretense that he secured power in a free and fair election.

Modern informational autocrats also make extensive use of censorship. Russia ranks in the bottom 20 percent of the press-freedom rankings compiled by Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders. Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net Index shows that the Internet is less free in Russia than in Belarus, Kazakhstan or Turkey, reflecting the importance of online censorship in an informational autocracy with high Internet penetration.

According to the Google Transparency Report, Russia leads the world in official requests to remove online content. In the first half of last year, Russia placed more than 10,000 requests to remove content. The second-place country, Turkey, had just 1,000 requests. (China is not included in the ranking.)","Russian state media sounded a triumphal tone in the December 27th announcement that the first Avangards are now ready for launch, even specifying the exact hour of combat readiness for the nuclear-armed hypersonic glider.The weapon was deployed with a missile division in the Orenburg region 900 miles southeast of Moscow.The weapon was spurred by Moscow’s fears that the U.S. missile defense program will eventually be capable of intercepting and destroying conventional Russian ICBMs, and thus encourage America to launch a first strike without fear of Russian nuclear retaliation.Putin “has the Avangard’s ability to evade U.S. missile defense systems,” noted the Moscow Times.Read the original article.","So what explains Putin’s enduring popularity?The answer — for Putin and other modern autocrats — lies in the ability to control the information that people receive, which enables a leader to convince most of the population that, despite the regime’s imperfections, it is the country’s best option.This approach enabled Putin to maintain the pretense that he secured power in a free and fair election.Modern informational autocrats also make extensive use of censorship.According to the Google Transparency Report, Russia leads the world in official requests to remove online content.","<s> Teheran Seit dem Ausstieg der USA und neuer Sanktionen gegen Teheran wackelt das Atomabkommen mit dem Iran.

A Miami County judge recently scheduled the trial of Ethan Cain of Marion and Joshua Kean of LaFountaine to begin April 13 in the killing of 22-year-old Drake Smith, the Kokomo Tribune reported.

Both men face felony charges of murder, obstruction of justice and robbery resulting in serious bodily injury, while Kean also is charged with assisting a criminal.

Cain, 23, and Kean, 25, allegedly beat Smith to death with a metal pipe in May 2018 in the Frances Slocum State Forest, near Peru.

Police said both men were part of a plot organized by 19-year-old Brittany Morris of Jonesboro to rob Smith of drugs and money. Cain and Kean allegedly attacked the Summitville man after a party in the forest.

Police said Cain, Kean and Morris then fled the scene with Smith’s clothing, cash, drugs, beer and a small speaker. Kean and Cain were arrested days later in southern California.

Morris is set to stand trial in June on several charges, including aiding or inducing murder.

Officers blocked the road off at either end over fears it may collapse.

And the road surface has now given way and begun to cave in on a stretch in front of the terraced houses north of the junction with Andrew Road.

They were all over each other’s social media feeds, dancing and smoking cigars on Monday night as LeBron James celebrated his 35th birthday.

Because the Lakers play the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night, New Year’s Eve celebrations are expected to be significantly toned down. James said he only decided three days before the big night that he would have a party at all, which his wife Savannah helped assemble on the short turnaround. It wasn’t just a birthday, but a turning of the page on the year as well.

“I was able to kill two birds with one stone, get my teammates there, coaching staff, my family, my friends, people that’s been around for quite a while and we had a heck of a time,” he said. “So it was another opportunity for us to bond, which we did. And if it brings us closer, then fantastic. That’s what it’s all about for me, bringing us closer to family as possible.”

The Lakers ended 2019 pretty tight-knit, with a strong body of work behind them. Leading the Western Conference standings and finishing a challenging December slate at 9-5, some of their hardest work is behind them even though the bulk of the schedule remains.

The year wrapped on an upbeat note with wins over the Portland Trail Blazers and Dallas Mavericks. After that second victory, Coach Frank Vogel had a chance to look at the footage of his team holding the No. 1 offense in the NBA to just 95 points – to his surprise, he saw some opportunities where his defense (104.8 defensive rating, No. 7 in the NBA) could be even better.

That’s the Lakers’ 2019 resolution: They’re still looking for the perfect performance.

“It’s just reason for optimism that we still have a long way to go and a lot of room for improvement,” he said. “It’s exciting what we can be.”

A big part of that has been success against the teams they are supposed to beat: The Lakers are 17-0 against teams under .500 this season. They’ll have an opportunity to extend that perfection with upcoming home games against Phoenix, New Orleans, Detroit and New York.

The Lakers warmed to the challenge of their tough schedule last month, playing a host of teams bound for the playoffs. The concern, Vogel acknowledged, is that over a third of the way in against less-than-stellar competition, complacency can sneak in.

“It’s a different sort of stretch right now,” he said. “I think we begin to enter the dog days of the NBA season, which is like now until All-Star break where it gets a little monotonous and there’s a little bit of a grind and hopefully we can get through that stretch. And then once All-Star break hits, you’re in the home stretch after that.”

One of the factors the Lakers feel is in their favor is chemistry. Multiple players have cited the 1-through-15 chemistry on the roster as a strength, and James’ birthday party was the latest event where the Lakers have largely shown up off the court as a group.

James pointed to his youth league days as a model: When he was a young player, he and his teammates would go to parks or malls and play video games together.

“Not only did it influence the way I play on the court, having an effect on how I play today, it also had an influence of how I grew up with my friends, too, and having that brotherhood,” he said. “If you know anything about my childhood, the guys that I grew up playing ball are still around, they’re still like my best friends.”

The same concept is important to his NBA teams, James said, which is among the reasons everyone was invited. The feeling of the Lakers is that off-court chemistry will help form on-court bonds that can help them in competitive games.

It also leads to some nice post-party texts.

“The best thing about it is that my teammates said how much of a time they had,” he said. “My family and my friends had a heck of a time. Got a lot of messages this morning saying how much fun it was, how much love was in the air. So that’s what makes it cool for me. The people around me had a good time.”

For us here at the Packet we look back on a successful year, as more people than ever before are reading what we write.

That growth has come on our digital platform, thepacket.co.uk

At the close of 2019, more than five million pages had been read on our website – around two million more than in 2018.

We continue to have a loyal audience in print too and we thank those who believe that our journalism is worth paying money for each week.

In 2020 we as a news outlet and, indeed, an industry, continue to fight on various fronts.

Aside from battling to secure the advertising revenue needed to survive, one that regularly rears its rather ugly head is the concept of 'fake news'. This is a term that gets thrown around all too frequently, usually to express dismay at a story that one simply doesn't agree with.

The actual definition is the deliberate spread of disinformation or hoaxes via the media. A few weeks ago the editor of a Yorkshire newspaper had to do battle with the 'fake news' claims and it's a great example of why trusted local news is more important than ever as we head into a new decade.

The story in question was about a young boy who had to sleep on a hospital floor because there were no beds.

Social media went into meltdown, slamming the newspaper, saying it simply couldn't be true.

The newspaper explained how it had done the basic journalism of verifying the story with the hospital before publication, while those on social media could hide behind a moniker and publish spurious claims without a single check.

We had our own example recently, where one of our reporters picked up on a story via social media. That's often the way these days – but social media is merely another source and we will always then verify any information before publishing a story. This particular one involved cameras appearing in Helston. One person gave an apparent explanation on the original social media post, which resulted in another person saying ""social media wins again, who needs local newspapers?""

But what had been written wasn't right, we discovered when we asked the council about it, and we then went on to publish our story, with the correct explanation.

And that's the difference – you can't believe everything you read on social media, but when it's published under the banner of the Packet, you can be assured that it has been verified before being published.

Thank you for your support and I wish you a happy New Year.

However, considerable flexibility in hunter-gatherer cultures has led to their characterization as primarily multilocal. Horticulturalists are associated with larger, more sedentary social groups with more political inequality and intergroup conflict and may therefore provide additional insights into evolved human social structures. We analyze coresidence patterns of primary kin for 34 New World horticultural societies (6,833 adults living in 243 residential groupings) to show more uxorilocality (women live with more kin) than found for hunter-gatherers. Our findings further point to the uniqueness of human social structures and to considerable variation that is not fully described by traditional postmarital residence typologies. Sex biases in coresident kin can vary according to the scale of analysis (household vs. house cluster vs. village) and change across the life span, with women often living with more kin later in life. Headmen in large villages live with more close kin, primarily siblings, than do nonheadmen. Importantly, human marriage exchange and residence patterns create meta-group social structures, with alliances extending across multiple villages often united in competition against other large alliances at scales unparalleled by other species.","Elena Esposito

As the Second Amendment conflict heats up across the United States, here’s another “crazy conspiracy theory” that has turned out to be true.

The United Nations is hiring in New York. What positions are they trying to fill?

English-speaking DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION, AND REINTEGRATION OFFICERS.

This job was posted the day after Christmas. So for all the folks who have been saying “nobody is trying to take your guns” you might want to read this job listing and reconsider your opinion.

Is this in response to the Virginia crisis?

You may recall that citizens of Virginia have become outraged recently by new laws that are likely to pass this month, effectively banning all semi-automatic weapons. Sanctuary counties, cities, and municipalities now cover all but the most urban parts of the state. These sanctuaries have vowed to support the Second Amendment and are refusing to enforce unconstitutional gun laws.

In response, a member of the state congress suggested that Governor Northam could call up the National Guard to disarm residents of Virginia despite the wishes of local governments. In response to that, at least one county has formed a militia and others are expected to spring up. The state’s Attorney General says that these sanctuaries carry no legal weight.

Despite the AG’s opinion and threats from the state government, Virginians appear to have no plans to give up their guns or register them. Many members of law enforcement entities and the National Guard have said that they will not act on unconstitutional orders.

One has to wonder if this is why the UN is hiring “disarmament officers?”

What is the job description?

Here are the responsibilities for the new hires, as per the United Nations job listing.

Within delegated authority, the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer will be responsible for the following duties:

• Acts as a Focal Point for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) components for two to three missions, responsible for planning, support to implementation and evaluation;

• Participates in DPO and Integrated Task Force planning meetings for the establishment of a new peacekeeping mission with a potential DDR component;

• Provides technical assistance to peace negotiations;

• Participates in technical assessment missions;

• Advises, develops and reviews (as appropriate) initial DDR functional strategy and concept of operations for further development into a full programme by the DDR component and the National DDR Commission;

• Drafts and reviews DDR inputs to SG report, code cables, and talking points;

• Develops initial result-based framework and budget for new DDR components in new mission;

• Liaises with UNDP and donor community to raise voluntary contributions for DDR programmes;

• Presents and/or defends new and subsequent DDR budgetary requirements in the ACABQ and the 5th Committee of the General Assembly;

• Develops staffing structure and terms of reference for a DDR component, including terms of integration with other UN agencies, funds and programmes;

• Provides technical clearance for applicants to DDR units in new and ongoing missions;

• Provides Headquarters support in planning the civilian and military logistics support for DDR;

• Continually reviews DDR programme strategy and implementation through relevant documents, reports and code cables;

• Conducts field missions to assess implementation of established DDR programmes;

• Identifies potential problems and issues to be addressed and suggests remedies to DDR units in the field;

• Liaises with Member States, UN actors and other DDR interested partners to represent the mission’s DDR component at the Headquarters level;

• Establishes and maintains an outreach network with CSOs and IGOs active in the area of DDR.

• Supports the doctrine development work in the area of DDR in the department, with the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on DDR and other relevant national and international actors working on DDR issues;

• Contributes to Department-level or Policy Committee-level policy development work on DDR and related issues;

• Maintains and further develops the Integrated DDR Standards – a set of inter-agency policies, guidelines and procedures on DDR;

• On behalf of the Chief of the DDR Section, co-chairs the IAWG on DDR, contributes to bringing coherence to the interaction of the UN system and its partners on DDR;

• Supervises the Associate Expert (Junior Professional Officer) in the development and maintenance of the web-based United Nations DDR Resource Centre;

• Liaises with others (UN, regional organisations and Member States) providing DDR.

Other duties as required. (source)

Also notable is the required language fluency – English – and the desired experience.

Seven years of relevant experience in disarmament affairs, political analysis or in national military or paramilitary service, preferably related to the design, implementation or review of DDR. (source)

Employees would answer to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

As per the UN, here are some specifics about this job description. Of special note:

Disarmament is the collection, documentation, control and disposal of small arms, ammunition, explosives and light and heavy weapons of combatants and often also of the civilian population. Disarmament also includes the development of responsible arms management programmes. (source)

As well, the UN especially wants women to apply for this job, citing gender equality. But is it possible they think that a gun owner might have more ethical difficulty firing on a woman trying to take their weapons than a man?

The US is no longer part of the UN Arms Trade Treaty.

You may recall back in 2013, the United Nations convinced then-Secretary of State John Kerry to sign a treaty that “unequivocally bans arms transfers that are in violation of a U.N. arms embargo or that exporters have reason to know will be used to commit genocide and other grievous war crimes.”

In 2013, the US signed the UN Arms Trade Treaty but that signature was never ratified. Last April, President Trump officially withdrew from the international gun control treaty.

However noble that may sound, anti-gun control activists were concerned this would lead to the UN being able to disarm Americans on US soil.

So why is the UN looking for English-speaking disarmament experts?

Don’t be silly, “no one is coming to take your guns.”

How many times has someone told you not to worry – that nobody is coming to take your guns away? That all they want is “common-sense gun laws?”

In light of the current political climate and this job listing, I’d say that is an outright a lie.

What do you think about this job listing? Alarming or not? Please share your thoughts in the comments.

Activist Greta Thunberg attends a climate strike outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm on December 20. During an interview Monday, Greta said she doubts she would have talked to President Trump at last fall’s climate summit in New York because “he’s not listening to the scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?” (Pontus Lundahl/TT via AP)

Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg said Monday that talking to President Trump at a United Nations summit on global warming would have been a waste of time, because he would not have paid attention.

In an interview with BBC radio’s “Today” program, for which she was the guest editor Monday, Greta also said that she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life.

A video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a “death stare” at a U.N. climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.

Asked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Greta said: “Honestly, I don’t think I would have said anything because obviously he’s not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?

“So I probably wouldn’t have said anything. I wouldn’t have wasted my time,” she said.

This month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Greta “a brat.” Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem.

“Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don’t mean anything,” she said. “I guess of course it means something — they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don’t want — but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat.”

Greta came to world attention when she began a grass-roots campaign at age 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change.

Thunberg, who was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering.

The teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid.

“I hope I won’t have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don’t have to be a climate activist anymore,” she said, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August.

“I just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager.”

Przyszłość nie wybierającego się bynajmniej na polityczną emeryturę Donalda Tuska z pewnością zaciąży nad kształtem całej opozycji.



fot. screen YouTube

Nie wystartuje w wyborach prezydenckich, nie zamierza ubiegać się o pozycję lidera opozycji, nie zgłasza aspiracji do powrotu na funkcję przewodniczącego Platformy Obywatelskiej.



Wydawać by się mogło, że Donald Tusk zniknął z polskiej sceny politycznej, chociaż właśnie powrócił do kraju. A jednak wszystkie kalkulacje co do jej przyszłego kształtu obracają się właśnie wokół byłego premiera.



Mało kto wierzy, aby nie chciał on jeszcze odegrać na niej istotnej roli. Jedni twierdzą, że myśli głównie o starcie w wyborach prezydenckich w 2025 roku, drudzy sądzą, iż jego marzeniem jest utworzenie dużej partii, przy czym zdania na temat tego, czy będzie chciał połączyć PO z Koalicją Polską, czy też z ugrupowaniami lewicowymi bądź z formacją, jaka może powstać wokół ubiegającego się o prezydenturę Szymona Hołowni są na razie podzielone.



Jedno wydaje się pewne: żeby mógł zrealizować swoje plany, na czele Platformy musi stanąć sprzyjający mu polityk, na pewno więc nie Grzegorz Schetyna. I to jest zadanie dla Tuska na najbliższe dni. A że należy do mistrzów zakulisowych rozgrywek, obecny lider PO i Koalicji Obywatelskiej ma się czego obawiać, chociaż i on potrafi nieźle sobie radzić w tej materii.



Przyszłość nie wybierającego się bynajmniej na polityczną emeryturę Donalda Tuska z pewnością zaciąży nad kształtem całej opozycji.



","Goście programu ""Minęła 20"" zostali zapytani o wpis Leszka Jażdżewskiego, który napisał na Twitterze, że lider opozycji ""powinien być jak żona cezara"". ""Media donoszą o kolejnych przypadkach korupcji w szpitalu prof. Grodzkiego, które niestety wyglądają wiarygodnie. Grodzki powinien pozwać te osoby. A opozycja pomyśleć o wymianie marszałka senatu"" – stwierdził. Odpowiedział mu poseł PO Michał Szczerba, który bronił prof. Grodzkiego.

Zdaniem Antoniego Trzmiela, chodzi po prostu o ""walkę o władzę wokół Donalda Tuska"". – Historia jest prosta. Marszałek Tomasz Grodzki jest podgryzany przez tych, którzy wokół Donalda Tuska chcieliby stworzyć bardziej postępową siłę. Postacią wybraną przez Tuska był Leszek Jażdżewski. Wymienił bardzo progresywną agendę w jego imieniu. To walka o władzę wokół Donalda Tuska – ocenił.

Red. naczelny DoRzeczy.pl zwrócił też uwagę, że PO broni sprawy, której nie da się bronić. – Po stronie PO nie ma żadnej refleksji, że bronią sprawy, której bronić się nie da. Każdy wie, jak w latach 90. ten mechanizm wyglądał, choć nie każdy lekarz z niego korzystał – tłumaczył.

Hours after Iran-backed militia supporters stormed the the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Tuesday, President Trump and first lady Melania Trump walked the red carpet into the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago for his annual New Year’s Eve party.

Before entering the ballroom, the president lauded the U.S. military units that responded to the violence and defended the compound, adding that he would not allow “another Benghazi.” During the 2016 campaign, Trump often revived the 2012 deadly assault on a U.S. mission in Libya to chide his opponent, Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack.

“Benghazi should never have happened and there will never be a Benghazi,” Trump said. “We have the greatest warriors and they got there very quickly. As soon as they saw there was a potential problem, they got there and then there was no problem whatsoever.”

In a tweet earlier Tuesday, Trump blamed Iran for the attack and said those involved would be “held responsible.” On Tuesday evening, he said he hoped peace would prevail in the Middle East.

“I want to have peace. I like peace,” he said. ”And Iran should want peace more than anyone.“

The president last hosted the traditional New Year’s Eve party in 2017. The event went on as scheduled in 2018, but the president did not attend the festivities because he remained in Washington due to the government shutdown.

Club members and guests began strolling down the red carpet at about 8 p.m. Ivanka Trump wore a red satin gown and held the hand of her 8-year-old daughter, Arabella. Her husband, Jared Kushner ushered the couple’s two young sons into the ballroom.

Two of the president’s sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were also in attendance. Eric and wife Lara did not bring their two children - both under the age of three. Donald Trump Jr. was accompanied by his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The president’s youngest son, Barron, and daughter Tiffany Trump managed to escape notice as they navigated the walkway.

Other notables at the party included Rudy Guiliani, the president’s personal attorney, Fox News host Lou Dobbs, Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA.

Happy New Year!

This year’s party also comes as Trump has spent the better part of his 17-day holiday visit in Palm Beach seething over his impeachment in a partisan vote by the U.S. House earlier this month.

On Tuesday evening, the president again had harsh words for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Democrats and the impeachment.

“The impeachment thing is a hoax, a big fat hoax,” Trump said. “We absolutely did nothing wrong. All you have to do is read the transcripts ... Or you could also do something else. Go see and speak to the president of the Ukraine. The president of the Ukraine has said loudly and boldly that ... there was no pressure.”

The president said he was unconcerned about a trial in the U.S. Senate. “It doesn’t matter because we did nothing wrong,” he said.

Trump also repeated criticism of the House Democrats and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who Trump called “corrupt.” And he again called Pelosi over-rated.

“What the Democrats did in the House was a disgrace,” he said, noting that while no Republicans supported the impeachment, three Democrats voted against it and one in their ranks, New Jersey’s Jeff Van Drew, flipped to the GOP. “The impeachment thing, I call it impeachment light. It’s a disgrace. And Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself. She’s a highly overrated person.”

Trump had softer, more measured words for North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Right before Christmas, Kim issued a veiled threat about a “Christmas gift” for the United States, and American military forces have been on alert since.

“I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un,” the president said. “I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase. That’s what I’d like — a vase — Look, he likes me, I like him. We get along.”

Trump also noted Kim “signed a contract” to denuclearize and the president he said he expected the North Korean leader to abide by it.

As for the trade war with China, Trump said the first phase of a trade agreement will be signed on Jan. 15.

“I’m very excited about trade,” he said. “I’ll be going at some point to Beijing to meet with President Xi. We’ll be doing something reciprocal. But I think more importantly we will be starting negotiations very soon on phase two.”

He then wished the press a happy 2020 and asked them to be “honorable.”

“If you’re honorable, I am going to win the election by a lot,” he said. “If you’re not honorable, I’m just going to win by a little. So I’d rather you be honorable.”

Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly. They didn’t get one Republican House vote, and lost 3 Dems. They produced no case so now she doesn’t want to go to the Senate. She’s all lies. Most overrated person I know!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

In addition, Trump spent much of Tuesday focused on violence toward a U.S. diplomatic compound in Iraq. Early in the day, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad was stormed and damaged by what Trump said was an Iranian orchestrated assault.

Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

The breaching of the embassy involved Iraqi Kateb Hezbollah protesters and others chanting anti-American slogans who smashed glass, spray painted and set the embassy walls on fire while Iraqi forces reportedly ignored diplomatic protocol to protect the grounds. The attack was believed to have been in retaliation for Sunday’s U.S. missile strikes against Kateb Hezbollah, which is blamed for killing and wounding American servicemen in Iraq in recent days.

“I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn’t last very long,” he bluntly said when asked by reporters about a potential war with Iran.

The remarks were made only hours after Iranian-backed militiamen stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad and nearly triggered another Benghazi.

During a roughly 10-minute-long presser before the new year began, he also addressed his predictions for the U.S. economy, as well as his thoughts on North Korea’s recent antics and the Democrats’ flailing impeachment drive.

Listen:

The rest of the evening was far less somber at Mar-a-Lago’s annual black-tie New Year’s Eve gala, which Politico notes is “a $1,000-a-head event that starts with cocktails by the main pool before moving to a decadent dinner in the estate’s massive ballroom.”

“In the past, the shindig has attracted celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Woody Allen, Rod Stewart, Serena Williams, Martha Stewart and Robert Kraft.”

The president reportedly began the day driving to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach but quickly switched plans and left only 49 minutes after his arrival.

Though he received some criticism from the left over the perceived Obama-like optics of showing up at the resort, he himself took to Twitter later to dispute media reports that he’d actually gone on to play golf; and to note the difference between the Baghdad attack and Obama’s infamous Benghazi attack: His decision to take quick, immediate action.

When asked by the press about their resolution for 2020, the first lady said “peace” while the president said, without getting into specifics, that it’s something “good” for America.

“Peace is right, but I’m not sure you’re supposed to say resolutions out loud, okay?” he said. “So we don’t want to — I don’t want to say what my resolution is because I think we jinx it, all right?

Five businesses will be eligible to apply for a $2,000 grant to improve their retail environment in the first year of a new economic development program in Yorba Linda.

Editors’ Note: This dispatch is part of the Voice of OC Youth Media program, working with student journalists to cover public policy issues across Orange County. If you would like to submit your own student media project related to Orange County civics or if you have any response to this work, contact Digital Editor Sonya Quick at squick@voiceofoc.org.

The money for the program will come from the city’s share of revenue generated from the State of the City event. The city and the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce equally share proceeds from the annual event, which this year totaled $21,000, making $10,600 available for five grants of $2,000 maximum between now through December 2020, according to a city staff report.

The grants will assist the city’s business community in enhancing retail shopping, the report said. The program, which was unanimously approved by the City Council earlier in December, would allow merchants, retail centers, and business groups to promote their businesses.

Eligibility for the grant comes with some guidelines. A business must express a need for improvement to a building exterior or common area, according to the staff report. It must also explain how the enhancement will provide a benefit to the community and demonstrate a need for the grant that cannot be obtained through other funding options.

The application process includes a project description, plans, drawings or photos, and a budget. The city plans to review these applications within 15 days of submittal to the economic development manager with a final decision by the city manager, according to the staff report.

The City Council meets every first and third Tuesday of the month at 4845 Casa Loma Ave.","Support Oxnard initiativesFive citizen-sponsored initiatives are being proposed for the November 2020 election in Oxnard. However, Oxnard’s leadership considers them “dangerous” and instead of placing them on the ballot, the City Council ordered staff to write independent reports to assess their financial and other impacts. Will the city staff truly act as an unbiased third party when assessing these initiatives?

I have recently been campaigning for the city to disclose and publish, for all taxpayers to see, the actual cumulative total cost of several recent memoranda of understandings with the city’s unions. The city will only disclose a value that they call total cumulative cost, even after I have repeatedly demonstrated that these values are incorrect. The city’s published total cost values understate the actual cost by millions of dollars. So, even with mandated financial reporting, will the disclosed information be accurate? And why are they just now suddenly concerned about financial impacts when they freely hand out concessions to these unions? If anything is dangerous and/or placing the city’s future in financial peril, it’s these overly generous concessions. Did the city perform an assessment to determine long-term financial impacts before doing this? Probably not since these concessions go directly to city employee pockets.

It seems to many that the city is afraid that these measures will bring about accountability and fiscal transparency to city operations. The probable real reason the city has ordered reports is to develop politically-motivated rationale to discourage voters from approving the five initiatives.

The Argus Leader reports police responded to a report of a man walking into a casino near downtown around 8 a.m. on Tuesday, throwing a cup of gasoline on the clerk and threatening to light her on fire if she didn't give him cash from the register.

Police say she complied and he left the scene with an undisclosed amount of money.

Detectives found and arrested the 70-year-old man at a hotel. He faces charges of first-degree robbery and aggravated assault.

Police say the man was identified because he was wearing the same shoes and coat caught on surveillance video of the robbery.","We'll send breaking news and news alerts to you as as they happen!

Broken hearts were everywhere onstage for Mark Ronson’s headlining slot in a DJ-only show to see in the new year as part of Edinburgh’s Hogmanay’s main event.

Two pieces of a giant silver construction sit like a collapsed mirrorball, dwarfing the midas-touch producer as he sits inbetween, where his desk-top console resides.

Behind him, a twelve-strong all-female string section featuring Scottish Chamber Orchestra violinists Aisling O’Dea and Siun Milne, plus cellist Niamh Malloy swish out the sort of lush clusters barely heard since the Biddu Orchestra turned disco into a classical gas.

Other hearts are either framed in red as neon shapes zigzag about them, or else spiral round like Joe 90 might hatch like a Kinder toy.

Ronson moves through a set of the last decade’s bangers at a gallop.

He only pauses to don guitar for a brief guest slot from Daniel Merriweather, whose Ronson-produced mash-up of the Smiths and the Supremes on Stop Me remains sublime, despite his patter suggesting ambitions to be an international peace envoy.

Warm-ups came care of the vintage punky reggae party of Mungo’s Hi-Fi sound system and the old skool hands-in-the-air vibes of Rudimental’s Leon ‘Locksmith’ Rolle, accompanied by free-styling trumpeter Mark Crowney.

There are more hearts here, as Rolle gets the audience to make shapes with their hands.

All of which fits in with this year’s Be Together theme.

Not that there’s been much togetherness in responses to what some see as the serious mismanagement of Edinburgh’s Winter festivals.

The resultant brickbats raise serious questions regarding the event’s future - if it has one – that must be addressed.

In the meantime, Ronson’s medley of his own hits synchronised to the turn-of-year fireworks is a work of eye and ear-popping razzmatazz.

As are his slightly spooky closing renditions of Back to Black and Valerie.

The power of Amy Winehouse’s disembodied vocal is heightened by the image of her bee-hived visage that covers the stage wall.

Winehouse’s face is bent down, as if acknowledging the broken mirrorball below. All heart, as ever.","'It was great to see': Dancing security guards steal the show at Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrationsThey were certainly in the party spirit.

That certainly seemed to be the ethos of these two fun-loving security guards at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations on Tuesday evening.

They can be seen in the video above boogying along to headline act Mark Ronson just moments before the countdown to 2020 began in Princes Street Gardens.

One attendee to the sold-out event, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Evening News that even after the camera stopped rolling, the pair continued to cut shapes throughout the evening, regularly joining in with crowds and leading the celebrations.

They said: ""It was great to see. Sometimes people who work at these events can be quite stuffy and serious, so to see these two letting their hair down was great.

""It added to the atmosphere as they danced with other people in the crowd and joined families to bust some moves. They really got people going.

""That's what Hogmanay is all about.""

This year’s Hogmanay theme, Be Together, was celebrated by bringing together tens of thousands of friends old and new to share in a warm and welcoming moment of friendship creating a fantastic atmosphere across the Street Party.

Ronson dazzled the partygoers with some of the best tracks of the decade in a full throttle count down to the midnight fireworks. Daniel Merriweather joined him for Stop Me and Shallow.

Dozens of protesters and supporters of the Hashd Shaabi militia set up camp outside the gates of the embassy on Wednesday, one day after thousands converged on Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone to decry U.S. strikes that killed at least 25 militiamen on the weekend.

Several protesters set fire to the outside wall of the embassy, where heavily armed U.S. forces were seen standing on the roof of the building, witnesses said.

Some protesters suffered breathing problems from the tear gas, the witnesses added.

The U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday targeted the Kataib Hezbollah militia group, which was blamed for an attack last week that killed a U.S. citizen.

Chanting “Death to America,” angry protesters on Tuesday broke into the U.S. embassy compound and set fire to one of its gates.

U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the attack on Iran and said the country will “pay a very big price.”

Tehran has blasted Washington’s “irrational response” to the protests and denied any involvement.

Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi by phone on Tuesday and “emphasised the need to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.”

Defense Secretary Mark Esper called on the government of Iraq to “fulfil its international responsibilities” to protect US citizens in the country.

Mark Holmgren was 17 years old when he borrowed his brother’s motorbike. It was a decision that would alter his life forever.

“I was just driving too fast, turned the corner and I wiped out. I tore the nerves in my shoulder. It was a brachial plexus injury and from that day I could never use it. Couldn’t move it, couldn’t feel it.”

Holmgren, now 37, carried his dysfunctional arm around for nearly two decades before deciding it was time to do something about it this year.

“At first it was: I’m going to wait, they’ll be able to fix it, they’re coming up with new stuff, give me a robotic arm, stuff like that and I’ve been waiting too long,” he recalled.

“I just decided to remove it. Move on, I guess.”

He contacted doctors at the University of Alberta hospital, who agreed to amputate his right arm in April.

However, Holmgren didn’t want to depart with his arm forever—he wanted to have it preserved.

“First they sent me a paper, I signed it, sent it back to (the doctor). He brought it into the surgery room with me and just showed me all the doctors in there and they were all like,‘Yup, we know.’”

About a month after the surgery, Holmgren got a call from the lab saying his arm was ready to be picked up.

“I carried it out of the hospital in a garbage bag,” said Holmgren. “I actually kept it in my freezer for about a month.”

He admits that shopping around and asking taxidermy businesses to clean a human arm was a bit of a challenge.

“A couple of them told me no, like right away. There was no way that they were going to touch human body parts.”

But after a few weeks of searching, Legends Taxidermy in Drayton Valley agreed to do the job.

“I went and dropped it off, and got it back just before Christmas.”

Holmgren even brought his skeletal arm to Christmas dinner with his family.

“Some of them wanted to touch it, some of them don’t want to touch it. It’s just mixed feelings when people see it.”

The Edmontonian plans to show more friends and family his limb before retiring it.

“I’m just going to keep it probably behind the sink in the kitchen. I’m happy I did it. It’s just not for everybody.”","The Bishop of Worcester’s New Year Message 2020THE QUEEN began her Christmas message by referring to the 50th anniversary of humanity’s memorable first steps on the moon. Of Neil Armstrong taking ‘a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind – and, indeed, for womankind.’ She observed that it is a reminder to us all that giant leaps often start with small steps, going on to speak of the continuing need for peace and reconciliation in our world and how this generally begins with small steps.

It was a very timely message. One of the things I have been reflecting upon since hearing it is how we can only take such steps ourselves. Watching my children take their first steps was a joyous experience precisely because I couldn’t do it for them. First steps towards peace and reconciliation can be equally exhilarating to observe, but we cannot take them on behalf of others. We can only take them ourselves.

The Queen spoke ‘of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.’

There has been much talk of deep division in our country since the Referendum. It strikes me that we actually have much more in common than anything that might divide us and that if we can all take some small steps of reconciliation we shall come together in exciting and unforeseen ways.

May this New Year bring you many blessings and may you share them with others.

NORWALK — A three-car collision on Martin Luther King Drive sent three people to the hospital Wednesday afternoon.

A firefighter heading to work came across the accident and went to the assistance of the motorists, while alerting other emergency responders.

The collision took place at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday near Knapp Street. A BMW sedan ran off the roadway, and two male occupants in that vehicle were transported to Norwalk Hospital, according to the fire department. A male occupant of a Toyota Sienna van was also transported for medical treatment. No one was injured in the third vehicle involved in the collision.

A firefighter drove one of the ambulance while the paramedics tended to the patient, according to the fire department.

Norwalk Police are investigating the cause of the accident.","New Year’s eve crash kills oneThe Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Command in Ogun, on Wednesday confirmed the death of one person following an auto crash around J3, on Ijebu Ode-Ore Expressway.

Mr Clement Oladele, the state FRSC Sector Commander disclosed this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Ota.

Oladele said that the lone accident happened at about 11.25 pm on Tuesday.

He explained that a Toyota Sienna Bus, with registration number, FKJ 453XW, was on a high speed when it tyres burst and in the process lost control and somersaulted into the bush.

He said that nine persons- five male adults, three female adults and a female child, were involved in the accident.

“The corpse of the female victim has been deposited at the mortuary of General Hospital, Ijebu Ode, while two of the survivors are also receiving treatment at the same hospital.

“The third survivor who is a child was taken to Ise Oluwa Clinic J3 by a good samaritan before the arrival of FRSC rescue team,” he said.

The sector commander admonished motorists to desist from using imported used tyres and also ensure that they check the expiring date on the tyres before purchasing them to avoid unnecessary loss of lives and property on the highway.

opinion contributor

Editor's note: As 2020 marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment that opened the door for eventually all American women to vote, we invited Eileen Klein, a leading light for years in Arizona government, to write about the accomplishments of Arizona women and the challenges ahead. She does so in this open letter to Frances Willard Munds, who helped lead the crusade for Arizona women’s suffrage a century ago.

Dear Ms. Munds:

The dawn of this new and significant year seems a fitting time to recall Arizona’s role in women’s suffrage and share a bit of good news about the state of our state’s women today. We’ve come a long way over rocky ground, Ms. Munds; maybe farther than you ever dreamed?

One of the last states to join the union, Arizona was among the first 10 to recognize the women’s vote and has consistently supported women leaders since. Your quest for women’s suffrage, inseparable from the quest for statehood, speaks to the smarts, tenacity and can-do attitude of women in the American West and spotlights their courage.

Today more than 3 million women who call Arizona home have the benefit to live in one of the freest states in America, forged from the strength of our shared native, pioneer and immigrant heritage.

Still young, Arizona finds herself entering her second century of statehood at the forefront of America’s population and economic growth, presenting new chances, if not obligations, to build on the competencies and character of Arizona women.

Suffrage was once considered a threat

Perhaps it is just coincidence that your own grandfather, Alexander Hamilton Willard, was a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition, which recorded the first vote by a woman, Sacagawea. The lone woman and a kidnapped Native American, her very presence was instrumental to the expedition’s success, and her “equal fortitude and resolution” was praised by its leaders.

In any case, Ms. Munds, it was you who would reset the suffrage strategy, abandoning appeals to male legislative reason and instead go after the male popular vote following decades of legislative defeat — including a veto by a territorial governor who feared that granting women the right to vote might jeopardize the campaign for statehood.

After statehood was safely secured in 1912, you took advantage of our new state Constitution’s provision for citizen initiative, built a larger coalition of support, and with help from outside the state, won women’s suffrage immediately and impressively with nearly 70% of the vote.

We must pause and duly credit Arizona men with their important role in the victory. The use of citizen initiative, race and immigration would influence state debate and policy for years to come.

Arizona women vote and get involved

Elation quickly turned to election, and by 1914 women had secured seats in the Arizona Legislature, with you, Ms. Munds, as our first female state senator. Legislation to regulate the workday and increase wages were among the first to be considered.

It would take another two generations before statutes would be revised to remove the requirement that officeholders be men. Although you did not live to see the day, in 1988 Arizonans would use the title Madam Governor for the first time.

Today, women lead our electorate. Nearly 70% of eligible Arizona women are registered to vote and nearly 60% voted in the 2018 election cycle, with large increases in participation nationally coming from young women.

While not yet equal in number, Arizonans are known to elect larger percentages of women and more female governors than other states, once electing all women to statewide office and creating a national sensation.

Phoenix, now our nation’s fifth-largest city, is led by a woman mayor, Kate Gallego, and its public safety is led by a woman police chief, Jeri Williams, and fire chief, Kara Kalkbrenner.

Arizona elected her first United States senator, Kyrsten Sinema, in 2018. Her counterpart, Martha McSally, is the first female fighter pilot to command a fighter squadron in combat.

Women prosecutors bring wrongdoers to justice in our oldest (Sheila Polk in Yavapai) and largest counties (Allister Adel in Maricopa).

As a teacher, you will appreciate that several of our university and college presidents are women, including Rita Cheng, president of Northern Arizona University, and Maria Harper-Marinick, chancellor of the Maricopa County Community College District.

Many of them are America's leaders

Arizona women of color, who even after 1912 and 1920 would be excluded from voting in Arizona due to discrepancies in state and federal law and English literacy requirements, are making their mark.

Tucson has just elected its first Latina mayor, Regina Romero. Flagstaff’s mayor, Coral Evans, is African-American.

Beyond local communities, Hispanic, African American and Asian-American women hold statewide constitutional offices (Lea Márquez Peterson and Sandra Kennedy, Corporation Commission; Kimberly Yee, State Treasurer). Native American women lead several of Arizona’s 22 tribal nations.

Arizona has given America some of her most iconic women leaders. Shortly after statehood, an Arizona woman, Sarah Herring Sorin, was the first to try a case unaccompanied by a man before the United States Supreme Court.

Later, a woman who grew up on a ranch in southern Arizona would become the nation’s first majority leader in the state Senate and go on to become America’s first female U.S. Supreme Court justice – Sandra Day O'Connor.

The federal bench includes an Arizonan who is America’s first female Native American judge, Diane J. Humetewa.

An Arizona woman, Barbara Barrett, serves as secretary of the United States Air Force.

Our nation celebrated a Navajo woman, Annie Dodge Wauneka, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work in public health.

A Tucson troubadour, Linda Ronstadt, who fused her Hispanic heritage with a mix of musical styles has won the highest of praises with a National Medal of Arts and Kennedy Center honors.

It is hard to imagine that the women’s vote once threatened Arizona statehood. Today, women define it.

Education is making womens' lives better

Thanks to further changes in federal law, coupled with improvements in health care, education and the economy, a baby girl born into Arizona in 2020 is more able to direct her own life and flourish here, certainly when compared to the baby girl of 1920.

She has independent access to the modern predicates of financial success, namely higher education and credit markets, giving her more opportunity to increase her earnings, build (and pass on) wealth and overcome hardship no matter her race or life circumstance at birth.

She has fewer children than generations before, but she – and they – are more likely to live longer. In Arizona, she can send them to the school of her choice, whether district, charter or private, or she can educate them at home.

Though her economic status is still likely improved by a spouse, it does not depend on one. In fact, with most jobs requiring learning beyond high school, a young woman’s future prospects depend more on her own level of education.

Young women seem to be getting this message. More of them attend and graduate college today, taking advantage of higher education institutions and subjects once closed to them, and opening doors to new career opportunities. (Even Barbie, the nation’s most popular fashion doll, has explored some 200 careers since arriving on the scene 50 years ago dressed in her swimsuit.)

But challenges still persist

Even so, a woman’s journey in the next 100 years is not guaranteed to be of ease. Wage and health disparities persist. More Arizona women and children live in poverty than the national average, a trend that has not improved even amid a growing economy. Women still marry but more also lead households with children, half of which receive federal assistance.

Arizona’s best opportunity and future success lies in addressing these challenges, which will be aided by improving educational opportunity and outcomes.

We hope women’s expanded freedoms and direct participation in self-government bring about a better life for them and their families, and that their increased presence in decision-making and empathic leadership traits bring about a better America, not just a different one.

After 100 years of tremendous change, we still are sorting out our relationships, family structures and lifestyles, working to reconcile that change with societal expectations and economic reality.

Few reforms in the name of women’s rights have enjoyed the same cohesion as suffrage. Some, like abortion, contribute to some of our largest partisan divides.

As women debate these and other issues and as they grow their influence, we hope they will value diversity of thought and demonstrate through civil discourse that a person does not find her voice by shouting over or shutting down the voice of others.

What's next for women in Arizona

Where last century’s reform efforts focused on statehouses and courtrooms, they are now being pursued in board rooms. More companies are recognizing the competitive advantage – and profitability – of fairness and opportunity.

Businesses across industries are working to increase leadership diversity, address pervasive sexual harassment, increase flexibility to accommodate family and move more capable women into management roles – the first step to increasing the pipeline of women executives.

Arizona is well positioned for this next round of reform. Women lead our state’s largest business and trade associations and hold top executive positions at privately held and publicly traded Arizona-based companies.

Arizona is recognized among the top states for growing clout among women-owned businesses. Arizona women lead the state’s largest philanthropic ventures and social service non-profits. Women as consumers drive 70% of the market.

If ever there is to be a perfect convergence of leadership, policy, business practices and social responsibility that benefits all people, it will happen here. As is Arizona tradition, we hope the next round of change will be made in in tandem with men – not as their subordinates, nor their superiors, neither in spite of them nor in lieu of them, but with them – in equal partnership and with equal responsibility.

And so, Ms. Munds, we gladly join America’s centennial celebration of women’s suffrage and pray for ongoing fortitude and resolution to continue the expansion of freedom for all people. For the Arizona we enjoy through your work and that of your contemporaries, and for lighting the path to a more just and equitable life, you have our enduring thanks and respect.

Yours truly,

An Arizona woman

This was yet another case of a good guy with a gun saving potentially dozens of lives. The notion of a good guy with a gun has been repeatedly derided by media outlets as a right-wing, NRA-funded narrative. However, the White Settlement shooting was far from the first example of armed Americans defending themselves, while saving the lives of others. (RELATED: Israeli Veteran: ‘America Has The Best Gun Laws In The World, Appreciate It!’)

After a back to school event in Florida last year was interrupted by gun shots, a bystander with a gun took down the shooter and prevented any casualties. In 2012, an 18-year-old mother in Oklahoma shot dead a knife-wielding intruder, potentially saving the lives of herself and her son. The mother, Sarah McKinley would not have had the opportunity to be armed in several blue states, where the law requires you to be 21-years-old to purchase or own a firearm. Several members of Congress and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have introduced laws that would bar adults under 21 from obtaining firearms.

A similar situation also unfolded in Oklahoma City in May 2018 at Louie’s Grill & Bar when a man opened fire on the restaurant and shot two people before being subdued by an armed patron. The only fatality in that shooting was the suspect. If all of the patrons had been unarmed, it’s possible that many innocent people could have been killed.

In August, an off-duty firefighter prevented a man carrying more than 100 rounds of ammunition from causing any damage at a Missouri Walmart. The firefighter held the man at gunpoint until police arrived, possibly preventing serious carnage in the process. Despite a good guy with a gun possibly saving lives at one of its stores, Walmart announced earlier this year that it would no longer sell handgun ammunition. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Says She Might Confiscate ‘As Many As 10 Million’ Guns)

In 2012, a 71-year-old Florida man saved several lives at an internet cafe after two teenagers walked in with a baseball bat and a gun. The man, Samuel Williams, was sitting at his computer when he witnessed the incident, and quickly pulled out his .380-caliber handgun to prevent carnage.

In 2010, a 69-year-old Alabama widow shot a burglar three times to protect her home. The robbery took place at 3 a.m., but the Alabama grandmother sprung into action with her .38 snubnosed revolver to keep herself and her home safe.

In 2016, a pregnant mother of two potentially saved her life and the lives of her three children with her firearm after intruders broke into her Ohio home. Her estranged boyfriend and the father of her unborn child attempted to break into her house, breaking down the door of her apartment. The pregnant women prevented a potentially tragic situation by being armed. (RELATED: Students Force University Of Virginia To End 21-Gun Salute On Veterans Day)

Despite the listed examples and many more, establishment media outlets have typically snarled at the notion of a good person with a gun acting to save lives. Susanna Lee of the international news outlet Quartz referred to a good guy with a gun as a “deadly American fantasy.” Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post called the notion a “Hollywood’s most dangerous lie,” placing the blame for mass shootings at the foot of one of America’s most left-wing institutions.

“Elected officials should be ashamed of hiding their inaction behind this vapid slogan. The industry that’s profited off this image for decades should feel ashamed, too,” Rosenberg wrote. “The entertainment industry has played an enormous role in promoting the idea of the invulnerable action-hero cop, to the detriment of civilians and police officers.”

The ominous PBS documentary “Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA” decried the NRA’s influence in American politics, and ridiculed NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre for saying that good guys with a gun have the ability to prevent mass shootings.

“And he almost immediately goes right back to what they usually say, which is that the answer to this is more guns,” CBS News political correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Ed O’Keefe says in the documentary.

Despite this being the settled wisdom of the establishment media outlets, the examples listed above, and findings by the FBI that good guys with a gun can and often do prevent tragedies. The FBI published a study in 2017 of mass shootings that occurred in 2016 and 2017, and found 10 incidents where a good guy with a gun engaged the bad guy. Of the 10 incidents, eight were resolved successfully.

“Armed and unarmed citizens engaged the shooter in 10 incidents. They safely and successfully ended the shootings in eight of those incidents. Their selfless actions likely saved many lives. The enhanced threat posed by active shooters and the swiftness with which active shooter incidents unfold support the importance of preparation by law enforcement officers and citizens alike,” the report stated.

The media and the left may not believe that a good guy with a gun can prevent a tragedy, but there are countless examples and an FBI report that suggest otherwise. It will be fascinating to see if these inconvenient truths are given the time of day as states such as Virginia fervently debate gun control.","The lone woman and a kidnapped Native American, her very presence was instrumental to the expedition’s success, and her “equal fortitude and resolution” was praised by its leaders.Arizona elected her first United States senator, Kyrsten Sinema, in 2018.Women prosecutors bring wrongdoers to justice in our oldest (Sheila Polk in Yavapai) and largest counties (Allister Adel in Maricopa).Flagstaff’s mayor, Coral Evans, is African-American.Women as consumers drive 70% of the market.","The mother, Sarah McKinley would not have had the opportunity to be armed in several blue states, where the law requires you to be 21-years-old to purchase or own a firearm.If all of the patrons had been unarmed, it’s possible that many innocent people could have been killed.(RELATED: Students Force University Of Virginia To End 21-Gun Salute On Veterans Day)

In a meeting with the Swiss charge d’affaires on Wednesday, Mohsen Baharvand, an assistant to Iran’s foreign minister, urged Switzerland to convey Iran’s protest to the US, and also tell them that Iraq is an independent country with freedom-seeking, independence-seeking, and honourable people.

“The US army has martyred at least 25 young members of the Iraqi nation and wounded scores of others without providing any evidence for their culpability,” Baharvand said.

“The Iraqi people would naturally show reaction to a country that has occupied their territory and is killing their youths. Americans have even bombed two areas in Syria at the same time. That shows they are seeking to achieve other goals, and are just looking for pretexts,” he added.

Baharvand said the American officials had better stop pinning the blame on others and levelling groundless accusations against the Islamic Republic.

The Swiss envoy was also told that Iran is not a hawkish country, but its hands are not tied when it comes to countering any threat and unwise move.

In that case, it will defend itself with full force.

“Instead of raising baseless accusations against others, the US government must learn how to speak to other nations and stop occupation,” the Swiss charge d’affaires was told.

Angered by US air raids that killed over two dozen fighters from Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) on Sunday, hundreds of protesters stormed its embassy compound in the high-security Green Zone on Tuesday, setting fires and chanting: “Death to America!” They also demanded the removal of American troops from Iraq.

Reacting to the attack, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday held Iran “fully responsible” for the incident on Twitter and added that the protesters “will be held fully responsible.”

In a separate statement, Trump later also warned that Tehran would “pay a very big price” after the attack.","Iran Summons Swiss Envoy over US ‘Warmongering Statements’The Swiss charge d’affaires was summoned on Wednesday over Washington’s accusations against Tehran and its stance on the latest developments in Iraq, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website.

During the meeting with the Swiss diplomat, an Iranian foreign minister’s assistant, Mohsen Baharvand, asked him to convey Iran’s strong protest to the US officials over their “warmongering statements” in violation of the United Nations Charter, the ministry said.

“He (the Swiss envoy) was reminded that Iran is not a country seeking war… but stands against any threat or any unreasonable act and defends itself with all its might,” according to the website.

US officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to accuse Iran of encouraging the protests underway in Iraq against US airstrikes on bases of Popular Mobilization Units PMU), also known as Hashd al-Sha'abi.

On Sunday, US forces conducted drone strikes on a number of Kata'ib Hezbollah bases in Iraq's western Anbar province, killing at least 28 individuals and leaving another 51 injured.

Kata'ib Hezbollah is part of Iraq's PMU.

Following the strikes, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that it had targeted three locations of the Iraqi fighters in Iraq and two in Syria in response to alleged attacks targeting American forces.

The incident led to a massive funeral ceremony for the Iraqi martyrs, followed by a huge rally by thousands of angry protesters who reached the US diplomatic mission in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, chanting ‘Death to America’ and burning US flags on Tuesday.

The protesters further held up signs calling for the US mission to be shut down and for the parliament to order US forces to leave Iraq.

Many protesters have set up tents, announcing plans for an indefinite sit-in until the embassy is closed and the ambassador expelled from the country.

A few hours into the protest, tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse the crowd.","In a meeting with the Swiss charge d’affaires on Wednesday, Mohsen Baharvand, an assistant to Iran’s foreign minister, urged Switzerland to convey Iran’s protest to the US, and also tell them that Iraq is an independent country with freedom-seeking, independence-seeking, and honourable people.“The US army has martyred at least 25 young members of the Iraqi nation and wounded scores of others without providing any evidence for their culpability,” Baharvand said.“The Iraqi people would naturally show reaction to a country that has occupied their territory and is killing their youths.Baharvand said the American officials had better stop pinning the blame on others and levelling groundless accusations against the Islamic Republic.“Instead of raising baseless accusations against others, the US government must learn how to speak to other nations and stop occupation,” the Swiss charge d’affaires was told.","“He (the Swiss envoy) was reminded that Iran is not a country seeking war… but stands against any threat or any unreasonable act and defends itself with all its might,” according to the website.Kata'ib Hezbollah is part of Iraq's PMU.Following the strikes, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that it had targeted three locations of the Iraqi fighters in Iraq and two in Syria in response to alleged attacks targeting American forces.The protesters further held up signs calling for the US mission to be shut down and for the parliament to order US forces to leave Iraq.Many protesters have set up tents, announcing plans for an indefinite sit-in until the embassy is closed and the ambassador expelled from the country.","ADAC

Freie Autobahnen an Ostern

ADAC Stauprognose für 9. bis 13. April

München (ots)

Der ADAC rechnet an Ostern angesichts der Corona-Krise und den daraus resultierenden Einschränkungen mit deutlich weniger Verkehr als in den Vorjahren und verbindet diese Einschätzung mit der dringenden Bitte, daheim zu bleiben: ADAC Präsident Dr. August Markl: ""In einigen Bundesländern sind Fahrten ohne einen dringenden Anlass untersagt, aber auch in jenen Teilen des Landes, in denen Fahrten theoretisch denkbar sind, möchten wir die Bevölkerung bitten, Fahrten nach Möglichkeit zu unterlassen, die verzichtbar sind. Dazu zählen leider auch Verwandtenbesuche.""

Trotz der Beschränkungen werden die Straßen voraussichtlich nicht vollständig leer sein. Besonders am Gründonnerstag, 9. April, - 2019 zählte dieser Tag noch zu den fünf staureichsten Tagen des Jahres - sind noch etliche Pendler auf dem Heimweg. Kurze Verzögerungen sind an Baustellen und auf den Ballungsraumautobahnen möglich. Ebenfalls etwas mehr Verkehr erwartet der ADAC am Ostermontag, 13. April, wenn das verlängerte Wochenende endet und die Pendler wieder zurück zum Arbeitsplatz fahren.

Autofahrer müssen auch damit rechnen, dass sie an den Osterfeiertagen auf Lkw treffen. Um die Versorgung der Bevölkerung mit Lebensmitteln zu sichern, wurde in allen Bundesländern das Sonn- und Feiertagsfahrverbot für Lkw befristet aufgehoben.

Von starkem Osterreiseverkehr ins Ausland ist wegen der Corona-Pandemie ebenfalls nicht auszugehen. Die Grenzen sind weitgehend dicht. Die Ein- und Ausreise nur aus triftigen Gründen möglich.

Stadia was criticized for missing and appending “coming 2020” to so many core features at launch. Precisely six weeks old at the end of 2019, Google’s game-streaming platform will truly grow up this year. Here’s a look at everything that’s yet to come.

Wireless Stadia Controller for mobile, desktop

Even if what appears on the screen is streaming from a faraway server, having a wire from your phone or PC attached to a game controller is not very futuristic. The first-party Made by Google’s signature direct Wi-Fi connectivity is only available on the Chromecast Ultra.

While the best and most familiar gaming experience for the majority is in front of a large television, mobile and web are what truly emphasize that no console is required. Those two form factors extend AAA gaming outside the home, and that’s a first for general gamers. The Google Store listing for Stadia Premiere Edition explicitly states that extended availability is “coming in 2020.”

Feature parity

Mobile

Closely related to expanded wireless Stadia Controller support is a grab bag of features only found when playing with Chromecast Ultra. For example, screen/clip capture is not available through the controller on mobile (or web), while Android devices can only hear voice chats. There is no way to respond or even start parties on smartphones. Similarly, Assistant is only available on the streaming dongle, with achievements not available on mobile yet.

Most of those limitations are presumably related to the Stadia Controller not being able to communicate those actions over a cable. Regardless, it’s confusing for people expecting the same experience on whatever device they want to play with.

Web

Gameplay on Mac, Windows, and Linux fares better than Google’s mobile operating system. The biggest feature limitation is 1080 p-only gameplay that does not allow users to experience Stadia’s 4K promise. Another gripe is the lack of “Data usage and quality” or “Display” settings online, while viewing Captures are mobile only — and all platforms could benefit from basic sharing.

Support for more Android devices and iOS

Stadia is currently limited to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4 family of devices. Google’s mid-range phones make it evident that flagships are not required to run Stadia. Of course, what people are really asking for is iOS and — specifically — the iPad. Any tablet would be better suited for mobile gameplay than a phone.

Google noted during an AMA before launch that it wants “Stadia to run on every screen eventually.” It hopes to “start expanding to more devices next year.”

Android TV support

Thanks to a leaked conference presentation, we learned in September that “Stadia integration” is coming to Android TV with Android 11 in 2020. This would be in line with a push to bring the service to devices that people already own.

In-game Google Assistant

Speaking of Assistant, Google’s cross-device help tool currently has very limited capabilities on Stadia. The most useful game-related functionality is asking to launch a title. At GDC 2019, Google imagined Assistant being able to find video walkthroughs when you’re stuck.

This is likely a more gargantuan task than meets the eye. Fundamentally, Assistant has to be aware of what’s occurring in games. That presumably requires developers to create in-game markers, with YouTubers making similar markups.

YouTube

Streaming

Another ambitious integration is YouTube. But to start with, Google could allow for basic gameplay streaming. This is surprisingly missing for a service that the company touted as generating an extra feed that’s specifically for YouTube.

Interactive sharing

More broadly, there is an opportunity to leverage the large gaming community on Stadia by just having them join streaming creators with Crowd Connect. Also interesting would be State Play where people could share a specific scenario and let others replicate or beat a scenario.

LTE, cellular gameplay

Stadia requires an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection, with LTE not explicitly supported today. That said, the workaround is just making a hotspot with your phone and connecting your laptop. Microsoft’s xCloud beta currently supports LTE networks, and Google could be looking to optimize.

Stadia Store improvements

At 26 titles with various editions, the Stadia Store badly needs search and not just curated sections. Meanwhile, pre-ordering has been hinted at, while “Family” functionality should extend beyond just parental controls. There should be the ability to share games even if only one user is allowed to play at a time.

However, the most important addition to the Stadia Store would be demos. The first aim is to let people actually test how the platform runs on their network for free, and would go a long way to address skepticism. Down the road, streaming Stadia demos could expose gamers to new technologies or concepts. The other reason is of course trying a title before buying.

Stadia Base and monthly Pro subscription

Joining Stadia is not as simple as you’d expect for a web service. A $129 buy-in is currently required with Google clearly wanting the first users to have everything they need to experience on a TV.

Stadia Base is expected to come in 2020 to let players just buy games outright without needing Stadia Pro. The $9.99 subscription provides 4K quality, a free game every month, and discounts. It’s a pretty good value, but most will make do with 1080p, especially to just try out how Stadia works for them.

That said, even more vital is some sort of demo experience that would truly showcase how accessing Stadia is as simple as clicking a link.

Ads in software are a great source of revenue for companies, but it’s usually something that users don’t appreciate. This week, Realme announced that it would be bringing ads to ColorOS following a year of massive growth in the Android market.

Nomad case for Pixel 3

Realme, for those unaware, is a popular Android smartphone maker, especially in India. We haven’t covered Realme much, but in 2019, the company managed 400% year over year growth which saw it take the #4 spot in India behind Xiaomi, Samsung, and Vivo. Part of that growth is thanks to Realme’s value on its smartphones which are usually priced lower than the comparable competition.

Going into 2020, Realme wants to “continue offering more surprises” by bringing “content recommendations” to its ColorOS skin over Android. Essentially, Realme is bringing ads to its software in order to help maintain a “healthy and sustainable business model” going forward.

This change will affect devices running ColorOS 6 and the ads on Realme devices will appear in two different places. The first is in the Phone Manager app while the second is on the Security Check page. The ads are enabled by default, but Realme users can disable them by going to Settings > Additional Settings > Content Recommendation and toggling the “feature” off.

Ironically, Realme made fun of Xiaomi earlier this year (via Android Authority) over ads that Xiaomi placed within MIUI, even showing it as a selling point of the Realme 3.

Avec neuf décès de moins qu’en 2018, l’Hexagone a quasiment stagné en 2019, enregistrant une très légère baisse de 0,3%, selon les données de la Sécurité routière.

""Ces chiffres sont historiques, mais ils sont le résultat d’une politique volontariste"", a déclaré le ministre, lors d’une courte allocution à Janvry (Essonne), en défendant le passage aux 80 km/h sur les routes secondaires instauré par le gouvernement depuis mi-2018.

""336 vies sauvées grâce au 80 km/h"" selon le ministre

Au total, ""336 vies ont été sauvées grâce à la mesure du 80 km/h"" depuis son lancement, a fait valoir le ministre, au moment où plusieurs départements, dont la Corrèze et le Cantal, ont décidé de revenir aux 90 km/h.

Les départements sont ""libres de décider"" grâce à la dérogation prévue par la loi, a ajouté Christophe Castaner, tout en les invitant ""à évaluer aussi dans la durée les conséquences"" locales du retour aux 90 km/h.

En décembre, 25 départements avaient fait savoir leur intention de repasser aux 90 km/h.","Le nombre de morts sur les routes a atteint en 2019 son plus bas niveau historique en métropole, un chiffre attribué par le gouvernement à l’abaissement à 80 km/h sur lequel plusieurs départements commencent toutefois à revenir.

Avec 3.239 tués, la mortalité routière dans l’Hexagone a atteint un chiffre « historiquement bas », s’est réjoui le ministre de l’Intérieur Christophe Castaner, lors d’un déplacement près d’une autoroute dans l’Essonne. Le nombre d’accidents corporels et de blessés est également en baisse.

Des résultats qui sont le fruit « d’une politique volontariste », a-t-il martelé, en défendant l’abaissement de 90 à 80km/h de la vitesse maximale sur les routes secondaires.

Au total, « 336 vies ont été sauvées » depuis l’entrée en vigueur de cette mesure en juillet 2018 sur 400.000 km de routes, a affirmé le ministre.

Neuf morts de moins

Statistiquement, la mortalité a quasiment stagné en 2019: la Sécurité routière a comptabilisé neuf morts de moins qu’en 2018 en métropole, soit une très légère baisse de 0,3 %.

Onze morts ont par ailleurs été recensés en trottinettes, un chiffre mesuré pour la première fois en 2019.

En incluant l’Outre-mer, où l’abaissement à 80km/h ne s’applique pas partout et où la mortalité et les accidents augmentent, le bilan atteint 3.493 morts, soit cinq de plus qu’en 2018, deuxième année la moins meurtrière de l’histoire."

He is an African American. There was a time when the two, a hate crime, and African American, were not only mutually exclusive but almost unthinkable. There was good reason. In the long vile, hideous history of racially motivated hate violence in America, African Americans have been the prime targets.

The legions of statutes, photos, and various exhibits that depict gruesome lynching scenes and mob violence against African Americans at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama is gory testimony to that. But even before Thomas welded his machete at the Hanukkah party in New York that had changed.

While Thomas's attack is a grotesque and extreme example of hate violence, it is hardly an aberration. More whites are the targets of racially motivated attacks by Blacks. True, some of the attacks against whites by Blacks are for their money and valuables. Others are revenge assaults by Blacks for real or imagined racial insults. It is equally true that most violent crimes against whites are committed by other whites, while most violent crimes against blacks are committed by other Blacks.

Yet even after discounting crimes that are hastily and erroneously tagged as racially motivated, many blacks do attack whites because they are white. Justice Department studies have shown that a measurable number of the hate crimes examined were committed against whites by Black attackers. The Southern Poverty Law Center which for decades has tracked hate violence in America notes that cases of Black-on-white violence has been more than an aberration in the last two decades.

More than a few ultra-conservative websites, loggers, and the usual motley collection of white supremacists and rightist extremist groups have jumped all over this and screamed long and loud that racial hate now comes with a Black face. This does several things. It puts the finger-point on Blacks as America's major hate mongers. It feeds into America's gun mania by igniting loud calls for fearful whites to arm and protect themselves from lawless Blacks. But most of all, it presents the false narrative that racially motivated hate violence is a grim product of a long bygone past, and that whatever hate violence remains is perpetuated by Blacks.

This lie has worked. Who better than Trump to prove it? He took much heat in November 2015, for his false, gross factually challenged, and deliberately inflammatory retweet of a favorite white nationalist talking point about Black on white crime. Said Trump, whites were in grave peril from being murdered by Blacks, and the stats supposedly proved that. The figures were quickly debunked. It didn't matter. The lie was out there, and countless numbers believed it.

Trump's racist bombast could get zero media and public traction if there weren't just enough white victims and, now as the attack on the Hanukkah party showed, Jewish victims of Black hate violence to make these fallacious claims seem plausible. That's stirred a kind of reverse prickliness on the part of many Blacks. The reaction has been either disbelief that Blacks can commit a hate crime. Or, there's the complaint that when Blacks do commit a hate crime and whites are the victims, the media blows it to the sky and federal hate crime charges are quickly slapped on the Black offender. The charge is there's a double standard in how the media and public perceives and reacts to Black violence against whites as opposed to white violence against Blacks. Thus, there is little outcry or condemnation of it by Blacks. Civil rights leaders and organizations, yes, but Blacks in general, no.

Worse, some Blacks quietly shrug off the violence with the bitter remark that whites have been killing Blacks for years and getting away with it, and that there has been no massive explosion of white outrage at the lax treatment of white killers.

The deafening silence by Blacks on this apparent racial outrage against whites will draw shouts from some that Blacks are hypocrites and have a double standard when victims are whites. They're not totally wrong. The victims of Thomas's rampage were innocents who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and were shot because they were white.

Blacks must mourn these murders as passionately as they do those of Black victims of white attacks and just as passionately call for the harshest punishment of the killer(s). The great strength of the civil rights movement was that it seized and maintained the moral high ground by never stooping to ape the violence of white racists.

The Thomas onslaught caused monumental pain and suffering to the victims' families and friends. It again dangerously heightens racial distrust and poisons racial attitudes. There must be no hesitation, pause, or equally bad silence in condemning these attacks. When Blacks say or do nothing about these attacks, it is taken by some as a tacit signal that Blacks put less value on white lives than on Black lives. There's only message in the wake of the stabbings. A hate crime is a hate crime no matter who commits it.

If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

Jones posted on Instagram that his son, Marlo, died Friday.

Since then, teammates and team officials have been showing Jones and his wife that they are there for them during the difficult time.

During a post-game press conference Sunday, coach Matt Patricia struggled while speaking about the loss.

“Marvin is a very special person. They are a wonderful family. He and Jazmyn are great people. My heart is just so saddened for them and with them right now,” Patricia said.

Former Detroit Lion Golden Tate wrote “The Jones Family” and “Marlito"" on his wrists, while Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, posted about the family’s strength on her Instagram.

Darius Slay said he had talked to Jones, but he wants to give him his space.

“Marv, that’s like a brother man,” Slay said. “We’ve been together here for a long time… for that tragedy to happen… I put all this weight on my shoulders, I pray for him.”

Matthew Stafford said he wanted to keep his interactions with Jones private, but he acknowledged that he was proud of the Lions family coming together.

“Obviously a tough situation,” he said. “It’s been awesome to see the support.”","ALLEN PARK -- Detroit Lions linebacker Christian Jones has undergone surgery to repair a shoulder injury that cost him the final three games of the season.

Jones said he underwent the procedure last Friday and is facing about two to four months of rehabilitation.

The veteran linebacker joined Detroit in 2018, as head coach Matt Patricia was installing his new system. He went on to start 29 straight games the last two years while making 77 tackles, five tackles for loss, three sacks, seven QB hits seven passes defended, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery.

He ranked 80th among the 88 linebackers who qualified for a grade this year, according to ProFootballFocus. But the Lions love his fit to the scheme and actually signed him to an extension in November that runs through 2021.

GM Bob Quinn doesn’t usually like to negotiate midseason, but wanted to keep Jones in Detroit for the foreseeable.

""Really good scheme fit for what we do, very versatile,” said Quinn, who was making his first public comments since extending Jones. “As you guys know, when we’re trying to build the front seven, it’s really hard to find linebackers that can play on the line of scrimmage and off. I think Christian has obviously shown he can do that at a good level.”"

People of the Caribbean Community, it is with a sense of immense pleasure, pride and humility that I greet you at the start of the new year, as the new Chairman of CARICOM.

Across our region, 2019 has brought more than its fair share of challenges, and indeed many of them, including the very daunting prospects of the climate crisis, are certain to follow us into this New Year.

But as we enter 2020, with no thought of defeat — we do so conscious that long before terms such as resilience and sustainable development were fashionable, we saw ourselves and we knew that we are a resilient people who for centuries have battled adversity of every kind, and we have always prevailed.

Our very history has been one of struggle but one of success!

It is against this backdrop that we can take a fresh look at the path we would wish to set for ourselves and our children, using a term that is no doubt familiar to us all.

It is my sincere wish that our approach to the advancement of our people in every country of Caribbean Community would be characterized by a level of clarity that is usually associated with 2020 vision.

For generations, the actions and the experiences of ordinary men and ordinary women of the Caribbean have left no doubt that they have always known what they have wanted for the inhabitants of these islands.

And we are no different today. In fact, many of us have demonstrated what true integration really means, in spite of the obstacles of bureaucracy that we sometimes confront in our leadership class as we go about our ordinary business.

But at the same time, we recognise that the regional integration movement is very much a relay race. Sometimes we are hard on ourselves, expecting to achieve overnight that which requires patience and careful nurturing over generations.

Our vision to better the lot of our people has remained constant — from the very early days of the Montego Bay Conference in 1947 on Closer Association of the British West Indian Colonies, to the West Indian Fédération of 1958 to 1962 most ably led by the founder of my own political party, the Right Excellent Sir Grantley Adams.

From the establishment of CARIFTA on December 15, 1965 – ten weeks after I was born – at Dickenson Bay in Antigua, to its transformation into the Caribbean Community, the institution we now know, the document signed on July 4, but coming into force on Emancipation Day, August 1, 1973 at Chaguaramas in Trinidad, or to the 1989 Grand Anse Declaration in Grenada that signaled our determination to remove the disadvantages of size and geography from our national development through the commitment to establish the Single Market and Single Economy.

Our process has therefore been one that has moved from generation to generation of committed Caribbean people, to the building of a regional integration movement that will allow us always to work to provide the best lives possible for our people.

Lest we be influenced by those who would only see a half empty glass, rather than one that is half full, may I remind us all that the European integration movement started on April 16, 1948 so as we enter the third decade of the 21st century they too are still working to perfect that union, despite having far more resources than we have ever had in the Caribbean.

I pray, therefore, that 2020 will strengthen us to run our leg of this regional integration relay race with confidence.

I pray that as leaders of the Caribbean Community we will work to give our people renewed confidence and inspiration to help us run this leg, while staying focused on achieving the next phase of critical progress.

And what is that next phase? We are duty bound to continue this journey across the Community whether as a collective of the whole or in twos and threes where we are gathered in a way that will:

Remove the obstacles to passport-free movement between our nations; Make it easier for Caribbean people to go and work where there are opportunities in the Community in a way that is hassle-free in the same way that we have done it for the movement of capital. In keeping with our own Errol Barrow’s vision, the reality of our people must not only be a lived reality but also a legal reality. The Caribbean Community must lead the world in shaping an environment within which migrants among us can live and work with dignity. After all, our modern settlement in the Caribbean has been nothing but that of a community of migrants; Truly advance the process of a single domestic space for transport and communications in the region by working to provide more affordable and reliable air and sea links between our countries and also to establish a single domestic rate for telecommunications and phone calls within CARICOM; Work with the private sector and the labour movement to provide further opportunities beyond transport and communications mentioned above, to food security, to opportunities in the blue economy or renewable energy and ICT for our people – opportunities for investment and for employment; Enable us as we face the climate crisis, to pool the funds of the region in order to be able to finance our own development trajectory for sustainable development so that we may adapt to the new realities of the climate crisis. This will require us coming up with innovative instruments that will better allow us to access the capital that we are not now accessing at a global level. Let us remember that those who help themselves will always be helped by others but we must help ourselves first by pooling our own resources.

My message, in essence, is that 2020 can and must provide the platform for a positive spirit of hope and optimism and a fierce determination to come together as Caribbean people to purposefully carry forward the transformation of our region into a space that truly values, nurtures, and provides concrete opportunities for every Caribbean man, woman and child to run our leg of this relay.

But our pathway toward a better life for our people will not open up the opportunities we seek if we focus only on ourselves and our region. While we look ahead, we must do so fully cognizant of the advances we are making in claiming our Atlantic destiny as a region as we reach out to our brothers and sisters on the African continent.

We have already started discussions at the highest levels on the African continent with people with whom many of us share a common ancestry and history and who, like us, recognize the imperative of mutual cooperation as we go into 2020.

CARICOM has accepted the offer of shared office space from the Government of Kenya in Nairobi. We need to open it urgently and advance our interests in the city that is indeed the home of the UN Environmental Programme and UN Habitat both of which deal with issues that are vital to our own development in the Caribbean Community.

Within the next six months, we will also work towards jointly hosting the first ever African Union-CARICOM Summit. We need to resolve as a region that we will not leave that gathering without laying the foundation for tangible progress in areas of direct air and sea access across the Atlantic, greater trade in goods and services, and more cultural exchanges between our regions.

In closing, I commend to people across our region the initiative we have embraced in Barbados. We have designated 2020 as the year in which we will work together to perfect our finer vision for all Barbadians, regardless of where in the world we live. We can only become better as Caribbean people if we hold to the maxim — Dare to dream; and always be determined to deliver.

But as we seek to use this year 2020 to perfect a finer vision for our island in Barbados, as we gather parish by parish, I want now to ask each of us as Caribbean people to do the same for where we want to go and who we want to be as Caribbean people for 2020 must be where we can perfect that fine vision.

All that is left for me to do is to wish you, each and every one, a blessed 2020 and to a greater and more powerful Caribbean Community!","America Ferrera expecting second childAmerica Ferrera has celebrated the new year by announcing she is expecting a second child with husband Ryan Piers Williams.

Reported Space News: ""Trump signed the NDAA flanked by top defense and military officials at a ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland."" https://spacenews.com/trump-signs-defense-bill-establishing-u-s-space-force-what-comes-next/ It quoted Trump saying: ""Today marks a landmark achievement as we officially inaugurate the newest branch or our military, the U.S. Space Force. This is very big and important moment.""

The Space News article quoted U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper saying at the signing December 20: ""Our reliance on space-based capabilities has grown dramatically and today outer space has evolved into a warfighting domain of its own. Maintaining American dominance in that domain is now the mission of the United States Space Force.""

Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space, headquartered in Maine, said of what happened: ""The words 'warfighting domain' and US 'dominance in space' indicate that the Pentagon is actively planning to fight a war in space. This misguided notion is probably the most dangerous and frightening development of my lifetime -- and I had thought the Cold War-era was bad. The idea that the U.S. thinks it can fight and 'win' a war in space is indeed the height of insanity.""

The U.S. Congress joining with the Trump administration ""to push forward with this 'US exceptionalism to the max' notion indicates just how much the aerospace industry has taken control of Washington,"" Gagnon, of Brunswick, Maine, continued.

""It is clear to me that what the Pentagon has long called 'the largest, and most expensive, industrial project in human history'Star Wars,' will drive our nation's economy over the cliff,"" said Gagnon. ""There will be rockets and weapons in space and more homeless across the nation than anyone could ever imagine. Yes, we should call it Pyramids to the Heavens. The aerospace industry is the contemporary version of the Pharaohs of Egypt and the taxpayers will be the slaves. But everything has an Achilles Heel and the enormous cost of Star Wars could just be it.""

He stated: ""It's more than the right time for the public to declare a resounding NO.""

The formation of a U.S. Space Force and the U.S. drive for ""American dominance"" of space will inevitably turn space into a war zone because other nations, China and Russia and then more, will respond in kind. There will be an arms race in space.

The landmark Outer Space Treaty of 1967 was put together by the U.S., the former Soviet Union, and the U.K., and since signed by most nations on Earth. It was spurred, as Craig Eisendrath, as a U.S. State Department officer involved in its creation, by the Soviet Union launching Sputnik, the first space satellite, as he noted in the 2001 TV documentary I wrote and narrate, ""Star Wars Returns."" It's online. https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4w2h7 Eisendrath said ""we sought to de-weaponize space before it got weaponized""to keep war out of space.""

The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space, and although the Trump administration and U.S. military have been claiming a Space Force is necessary because of Russia and China moving into space militarily, in fact Russia and China -- and U.S. neighbor Canada -- have been leaders for decades in pushing for an expansion of the Outer Space Treaty. They have been advocating the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) treaty under which the placement of any weapons in space would be barred. The U.S.under both Republican and Democratic presidential administrationshas opposed the PAROS treaty and has effectively vetoed it at the United Nations. (I've been there to see this.)

""'Today is an historic moment for our nation as we launch the United States Space Force,'"" Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett told reporters Dec. 20,"" said the Space News article. ""The Space Force is the first new military service created since 1947, when the Air Force was born from the U.S. Army Air Corps,"" it continued .

""The Space Force authorization marks a huge political victory for Trump, who started championing the idea of a space service in early 2018 and directed the Pentagon in June 2018 to figure out a plan to make it happen,"" said Space News, quoting Barrett as saying: ""The president's vision has become a reality with overwhelming bipartisan and bicameral support from Congress."" Raymond: ""We do have a plan to rename the principal Air Force bases that house space units to be space bases.""

In a subsequent article, Space News reported that with the establishment of a U.S. Space Force, there is a plan to rename U.S. Air Force bases as U.S. Space Force bases. The piece said: ""Air Force installations that primarily do space work would be renamed Space Force bases. Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, for example, could become Peterson Space Force Base. Other candidates for re-designation include Colorado-based Schriever Air Force Base and Buckley Air Force Base, Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.""

The article quoted General John ""Jay"" Raymond, who has been commander of the U.S. Space Command and has become commander of the new U.S. Space Force, as saying: ""We do have a plan to rename the principal Air Force bases that house space units to be space bases."" https://spacenews.com/following-standup-of-u-s-space-force-air-force-bases-could-be-renamed-as-space-bases/?fbclid=IwAR06TsDxQAfTBHd8G2765Oiq_xQxL-3ofyWE8XzQ1tIPJfSr72UrSp9kMEo

Cantwell: Cybersecurity adversaries become more sophisticated and more organized day by day

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the top Democrat on the committee, continued her fight for consumers as Congress considers federal data privacy legislation.

“When the dust settles after a data breach or a misuse of data, consumers are the ones who are left harmed or disillusioned,” said Cantwell.

Cantwell highlighted the onslaught of data breaches consumers have faced, including a recent data breach that left unprotected the addresses, full names, dates of birth, income, and marital status of more than 80 million US households.

“Consumers continue to be bombarded by threats to their privacy. Cybersecurity adversaries become more sophisticated and more organized day by day, and we really need to understand privacy on a continuum of data security. We need to take a more proactive approach to cybersecurity and make sure that we are continuing to protect consumers.”

Some reports have estimated that more than 1,200 data breaches exposed over 446.5 million records in the United States in 2018. Worldwide, data breaches compromised more than 4.5 billion data records in the first half of 2018 alone. And this year, the largest ever single public data breach by volume was discovered – it exposed more than 772 million unique emails and more than 21 million unique passwords.

In light of these ever-increasing cyber threats, transparency, consent and plain-language notices are simply not enough, Cantwell said in her remarks, while pushing for a greater focus on protection of people’s personal data.

“While the benefits of the online world are everywhere…so must be protections of personal information that is more than just a commodity. We need to make sure that the culture of monetizing our personal data at every twist and turn is countered with the protection of people’s personal data.”

At the first Commerce Committee hearing on privacy in the 116th Congress, Cantwell criticized efforts to pre-empt laws from states like California, which has adopted its own privacy protections, in any federal legislation that Congress may consider.

Senator Cantwell has long advocated for more stringent protections for the privacy of American consumers, including when she questioned the CEO of Equifax on data breaches, when she questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and when she urged President Trump to veto a resolution passed by Congress to undo consumer privacy regulations adopted by the FCC.

Here is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell’s opening statement at today’s hearing.

In 2018 County Executive Chris Abele bought a 1920s lakefront mansion in Shorewood. In May, 2019, he announced plans to demolish the mansion. The Plenty of Horne story on this became the most popular one of the year. The column included other suburban news among its favored posts, including a review of the transit-unfriendly remodeling of Bayshore, a Glendale mall, and of a riverfront battle in the Village of River Hills.

Closer to home, a land purchase by Saint John’s on the Lake, the conversion of a Third Ward firehouse and memories of a nonagenarian South Side bartender were also popular with readers. A 2018 post wondered if a painting commissioned for the State of Wisconsin Executive Residence, and then evicted to the Milwaukee Public Library, would be returned to the governor’s mantle, and was answered in the affirmative in a March, 2019 column. A visit to Chicago for the 70th birthday party for former mayor John Norquist brought memories to many, including this columnist. A story from 2018 about the licensure of Rudy Giuliani, Esq. (or lack thereof) remained in the Top 10, and from the looks of things, might be back again in 2020.

I am grateful for all of the readers who have shown their support for Plenty of Horne and Urban Milwaukee in the past year, and look forward to serving you — and seeing you — in 2020.","Three straight years of falling crime rates — and yet Chicago has a long way to goAs families across Chicago look ahead to 2020, we want to take a moment to reflect on how far this city has come over the past year.

On New Year’s Eve, Chicago brought 2019 to a close with a third consecutive year of historic, record-level crime reductions across the city, with robberies, burglaries and vehicle thefts at their lowest levels in more than 20 years. And with the lowest number of shootings since 2014 and murders since 2015, overall violent crime in neighborhoods across the city dropped to a four-year low.

Opinion

These gains are the result of a data-informed, collaborative strategy with Chicago’s police officers, community-based organizations and street outreach groups who have dedicated their lives to keeping this city and its residents safe.

But make no mistake, we are not taking a victory lap. Our work will not end until Chicago is the safest big city in the country.

And while the numbers are improving, we know that statistics are cold comfort to the victims of the grinding violence that continues to traumatize communities across our city.

More than 260 teenagers and children were shot last year alone, 35 of whom saw their lives cut short by a bullet. While these numbers are down from 2018, this is still a grim reminder of the horrors of gun violence.

Whether it’s a 7-year-old girl shot early on Christmas morning, a child wounded by gunfire while trick-or-treating on Halloween, or 13 people struck by bullets after gunmen opened fire at a memorial; for all the gains we’ve made, it’s moments like these that show how far we still have to go.

These heinous, unconscionable acts have no place in our city, and we can never give safe harbor to perpetrators of violence.

Communities are shattered and families suffer from the on-going trauma of devastating and relentless violence. Such violence is not normal. We cannot allow ourselves to grow numb to it.

Now, more than ever, our faith must overcome our fears, and residents must continue to take back their communities block by block, together.

Ending the tragedy of gun violence demands that we continue our work to build trust between our police department and the communities they serve.

Trust is the best public safety tool we have. It’s earned through officers being invested in improving the neighborhoods they serve — one block party, one softball game, one community barbecue at a time.

2020 will mark Chicago’s first full year under the federally-mandated consent decree to reform our police department and lay the foundation for accountability and transparency. Its ultimate success depends on our officers viewing it as an opportunity not an obstacle.

As chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Charlie Beck led his city through its own consent decree, and worked to restore integrity to a department plagued by distrust and corruption. Now, as interim superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, he is laying the groundwork for our own road to reform and moving Chicago toward a policing model that relies on constitutional, compassionate and culturally fluent officers who carry a mindset of respect with them every day.

But our officers can’t do this alone. It takes an all-hands-on-deck effort. And they are being joined by violence interrupters, blocks clubs and faith groups that have immersed themselves into the fabric of neighborhoods under a singular mission to protect the city we all call home.

The violence we are facing is the result of years upon years of disinvestments in our South Side and West Side communities. It will take time to fix.

Whether it’s providing mentoring and group-based therapy to 400 teenagers at the highest risk of gun violence through our Summer for Change initiative; working with 30 neighborhood-based organizations to provide treatment services and job training to communities hit hardest by addiction and violence; or aligning an unprecedented $750 million in public, private and philanthropic investments into our South and West Side neighborhoods; the meaningful gains we make in public safety today started by investing in our people and neighborhoods and focusing on the root causes of gun violence.

In 2019, we drove down crime to a historic low and started to change the narrative in Chicago. And in 2020, we will change it even further together.

With a new police superintendent to lead CPD in its next chapter of reform, a first-of-its-kind Office of Public Safety Administration to modernize our public safety departments and a $11.5 million down payment in our violence reduction strategy — a 700% increase in funding compared to last year — we have already started building on this momentum.

There’s hard work ahead of us. But we are on a path to a safer tomorrow, and we will not turn back until all Chicagoans experience and feel the safety they deserve.

Daily Stormer

January 1, 2020

People should look at this as a kind of homework for the schools’ sexual education curricula.

Breitbart:

The scourge of sexual exploitation of children has reached “epidemic” levels in the United Kingdom, as nearly 19,000 children were sexually groomed over the past year. Local authorities have reported over 18,700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation at the hands of grooming gangs between 2018-19, more than five times higher than the 3,300 reported cases just five years ago. Sammy Woodhouse, a victim of the Rotherham rapist Arshid Hussain, said that the authorities have not implemented meaningful changes in combatting the crisis.

It’s almost as if the authorities wanted this to happen.

“You hear this bullshit line, ‘lessons have been learned’, but they haven’t learned anything”, she told The Independent. “I still hear a lot about the authorities aren’t doing things as they should. It’s not very often I hear something good and for all different reasons – if the police won’t act on reports, people feel they’re not being listened to or supported properly, or information not being shared”, she added. “I’ve said for years that this country’s in epidemic when it comes to abuse and exploitation. Authorities claim it’s under control but it’s not”, Woodhouse concluded.

Considering that the number of victims continues to increase and that the authorities themselves are reporting the increase… yeah, it’s obviously not under control.

Lancashire was the locality hit the hardest last year, with a total of 624 suspected victims, followed by Birmingham with 490, 447 in Surrey, 414 in Bradford and 409 in Gloucestershire. Thousands of more cases of abuse have been discovered across the country over the past decade, especially as the scandals of predominantly Pakistani male child rape gangs have been exposed. The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said that the figures demonstrate that grooming “remains one of the largest forms of child abuse in the country”. “The government has singularly failed to tackle this issue head-on. Its approach has been piecemeal and underfunded”, she said.

In order to tackle this issue head-on, another issue has to be tackled head-on: immigration.

That would be racist though, so the government won’t do it.

In 2018, then Home Secretary, Sajid Javid launched an inquiry into the ethnic origins of members of grooming gangs in the UK. Speaking to the BBC in December, Javid determined that the majority of perpetrators were of Pakistani origin. “When it comes to gang-based child exploitation it is self-evident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent high-profile cases there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, Javid said. “There could be – I’m not saying that there are – there could be some cultural reasons from the communities that these men came from that could lead to this kind of behaviour”, he added.

What does he mean “self-evident”?

These men look like average Londoners with English heritage.

See?

Besides, we have to look at the bright side here and consider that if British teenagers weren’t being groomed, then the men there would leave the country and search for sex elsewhere, and there would be no one left to pay the pensions and stuff.

The Economy would suffer and it would be a total disaster.

Silent Guardian of The Economy

There’s just no other way.

If we want The Economy to prosper, we have to allow these hard-working men to groom our daughters.","Fourfold rise in migrants rescued in English Channel: authoritiesLILLE, FRANCE - Over 2,300 migrants had to be rescued attempting to cross the English Channel in 2019, four times the number for 2018, local authorities in northern France said on Tuesday.



In total 261 cases of crossings or attempted crossings were recorded by the French and British authorities, mainly in small, often overloaded, inflatable boats, the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP.



Some 2,358 people had to be rescued compared to 586 in 2018.



Over the past year, growing numbers of migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have taken to the treacherous waters of the Channel in small fishing boats or inflatable dinghies.



Rights groups have linked the crossings to a police crackdown to prevent the establishment of migrant camps in Calais and other areas along the French coast.



At least four migrants died in 2019 attempting to make the dangerous crossing in the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with strong currents and icy waters.



A spokesman for the UK's Home Office said a Border Force cutter and two coastal patrol vessels were patrolling the Channel.



""There has also been a doubling of patrols on French beaches and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment have been deployed to stop small boats leaving French shores and arriving in the UK illegally.

• Trees absorb pollutants and gases in the air, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides, ammonia and ozone;

• In one year, an acre of trees provide enough oxygen for 18 people to breathe;

• Trees provide shade and keep us cool in hot weather. They can reduce temperatures on streets and in cities by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas concrete and asphalt are heat-trapping;

• Trees help us conserve energy by reducing the need for the use of air conditioning in houses where trees are present nearby;

• Trees conserve water by reducing evaporation of it by heat and by ensuring that water loss is minimized by absorbing rainfall through their root systems instead of losing it to runoff;

• Trees act like sponges and help remove pollutants from rainfall water before it reaches storm drains and bodies of water;

• Trees help reduce soil erosion and landslides with their root systems and reduce flood potential;

• Trees can reduce exposure to UVB rays from the sun by up to 50 per cent;

• Neighbourhoods and homes that are barren have been shown to have a greater incidence of violence in and out of the home than their greener counterparts. Trees and landscaping help to reduce the level of fear;

• Trees provide a home and a habitat for wildlife. Imagine how challenging it has become for bird life to find appropriate nesting sites to help raise the next generation of their species. Birds are being squeezed out of many communities due to a complete lack of nest-building sites;

• The beauty of a well-planted property and its surrounding street and neighbourhood can raise property values by as much as 15 per cent;

• Studies show that the more trees and landscaping a business district has, the more business will flow in.

• A tree-lined street will also slow traffic – enough to allow the drivers to look at the storefronts instead of whizzing by.

These are just some of the many reasons for us to preserve trees and make them a large part of our communities, instead of clear-cutting huge swaths of them for what is promoted as ‘affordable housing’ for our growing communities and instead becomes yet another money-maker for a developer who cares little about the frivolous topic of tree preservation in the community.

Trees have communities, too, and communicate with each other to help them preserve and care for themselves through transportation of enzymes through their root systems.

If trees could talk, they would tell us that by removing them in the vast numbers that we continue to do, they are no longer able to help protect us from the future that awaits us in a world bereft of trees.

Wake up, community councils, and smell the coffee before the only thing we will be smelling is the slow burn of our communities from the ravages of our rapidly overheated climate. Stop the carnage before Mother Nature turns her back on us completely.

The Roaring '20s are upon us again, but it's a different sort of sound as a fresh decade dawns in Michigan.

It's the roar of construction equipment in downtown Detroit. The rumble of Jeep Grand Cherokees at FCA's Mack Avenue engine plant. The howl of Detroit Lions fans as the beleaguered franchise tries to figure out what's been going wrong for the past few generations.

OK, there's nothing new about that last one. But the team fired four assistant coaches and the strength and conditioning staff Tuesday, so maybe there's progress even with the same old head coach and general manager.

Elsewhere, it's a new day.

The auto show will be pushed back into warmer days. A dramatic new tower on the old Hudson's site will continue going up, while a dreary Joe Louis Arena should finish coming down.

Two more priests could face charges in a continuing clergy abuse scandal, and the Novi man moldering in a Russian prison should soon come to trial.

Criminal justice reform is on the docket, and so is political redistricting. There will be a new garden on Belle Isle and a new movie about Aretha Franklin.

And, finally, the damned roads will be fixed. Or not.

We might need to check back on that one in 10 years when we welcome the Thundering '30s. But here's a look at what's almost surely coming in 2020:

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer presents her fiscal year 2020 budget proposal to lawmakers during a joint meeting of the House and Senate appropriations committees in the Senate Hearing Room at the state capitol in Lansing, March 5, 2019.

Road funding, criminal justice reform talks to resume

January is likely to kick off a Take 2 of the road funding debate in Lansing as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer presents a new plan to fix and fund Michigan’s crumbling infrastructure. The GOP-led Legislature panned Whitmer’s plan for a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase last year, setting off weeks of debate, stalemate and then massive vetoes in the state budget that were only restored in mid-December. It remains to be seen whether the governor and Legislature can reach consensus on a new plan.

Lawmakers are expected to continue efforts to reform Michigan’s criminal justice system, and a fight might be brewing over tax dollars diverted for the state’s contentious economic development programs. Several incentive programs are on the chopping block as is future funding for the popular Pure Michigan tourism campaign, as lawmakers debate whether the state should be funding the programs.

The 2020 election is expected to cast a long shadow over the work of government as presidential candidates vie for the support of Michigan voters and a large swath of state lawmakers and federal officials compete for re-election.

In the midst of election chaos, the Secretary of State’s office also will be moving forward with the selection of commissioners for the new Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission who will redraw voting boundaries for 2022.

Michigan a target in presidential politics

Many believe the road to the Oval Office will go through Michigan in 2020. The state, seen as a key battleground, will first weigh in on March 10, when the state holds its presidential primary.

But just nine days into the new year, President Donald Trump will have his first rally of 2020 down the road in Toledo, potentially coinciding with the beginnings of his Senate impeachment trial.

Political experts say the president is trying to capitalize on two swing states in one stop: Ohio and Michigan. Ohio, once an extremely competitive state, has trended more Republican in recent years, with Trump winning by an 8 percentage point margin there in 2016. But Trump won Michigan that year by just 10,704 votes, his closest margin of victory.

Trump, along with Vice President Mike Pence, recently visited Michigan for a rally in Battle Creek on Dec. 18 — the same day the U.S. House voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against the president.

The Mitten State will again be in the national spotlight on Oct. 15, when the University of Michigan will host the second round of presidential debates at Crisler Center, just weeks before the November election.

AG expected to weigh in on clergy abuse, Flint Water Crisis

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is expected to announce charges against two additional priests shortly after New Year’s in relation to a clergy abuse investigation that generated charges against seven priests in 2019. Nessel also is expected to announce a lawsuit related to chemical contamination in Michigan’s drinking water.

Whitmer also has said she expects Nessel to make announcements in early 2020 regarding the criminal investigation into the Flint Water Crisis. The attorney general is likely to run up against the statute of limitations for several potential charges in Flint in April, which will mark the six-year anniversary of the moment the city switched its water source from Detroit's water system to the Flint River.

Auto show to make summer debut

The Detroit auto show will see a big change in 2020. Show organizers officially announced in 2019 that the 2020 show would take place in June after decades as a winter staple in downtown Detroit. Show organizers plan to expand the show outside of TCF Center downtown to include outdoor events, and add to the annual Charity Preview event with an outpost in Hart Plaza. Showrunners and automakers expect the move to warmer months would add new experiences for consumers attending the annual event.

Chrysler plant to open, electrification ramps up

Detroit’s first new assembly plant in nearly 30 years is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s reconfigured and expanded Mack Avenue Engine Complex will produce the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and new full-size, three-row Jeep SUVs along with plug-in hybrids versions. Nearby, General Motors Co.’s Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant will idle starting in February as the plant is retooled to build electric pickup trucks and vans.

Ford Motor Co. also is upping its electrification efforts with the Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV, which is expected to become available in the fall, and the new F-150 pickup, which will offer a hybrid version in 2020 with a fully electric model to follow. Plymouth-based Rivian could begin delivering its electric pickup and SUV in late 2020.

Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler and French automaker Groupe PSA of the Peugeot brand will be working toward obtaining regulatory and shareholder approval to merge and create the world’s fourth-largest automaker. The combination, however, could take until early 2021 to close.

Third-grade students entering Michigan's K-12 public schools this fall will be subject to retention under the state's third-grade reading law if they are not reading at grade level on the state assessment in 2020.

(Photo: David Guralnick, file, The Detroit News)

Third-grade reading law takes effect

Michigan's controversial third-grade reading law allows educators to retain struggling third-graders beginning this spring.

The law, adopted in 2016, stops third-grade students from moving to the fourth grade —with some exemptions — if they read a grade level behind on the state's English Language Arts assessment, which measures reading, writing, listening and language.

However, Michigan will use a scoring system to make third-grade retention decisions that could promote thousands of students who still need additional reading help.

In 2019, the Michigan Department of Education approved a set of cut scores — selected points on a test's score scale — for third-graders taking the M-STEP in 2020 that will be used to make decisions for retentions.

Only 5% of third-grade students would have been held back under the new scoring system had it been applied to 2019 scores. That figure is in dramatic contrast to the 54.9% of third graders — or 55,336 students — scored less than proficient on the ELA test.

A decision in Detroit literacy battle

A ruling is expected early this year in a historic case over whether Detroit school children can access literacy amid deplorable conditions in their schools and whether the state of Michigan denied their rights when it ran the district.

A three-judge panel heard oral arguments in October in the 2016 case in which seven Detroit students allege a lack of books, classrooms without teachers, poor building conditions and extreme temperatures deprived them access to literacy in their public schools.

A lawyer for the state of Michigan, however, argued decreased student enrollment triggered a loss of financial resources to Detroit schools and that the state is not responsible for what happened in the district during its two decades of oversight.

Judges Eric L. Clay, Jane Branstetter Stranch and Eric E. Murphy spent more than an hour hearing from attorneys from both sides and asking questions about the case.

The class-action lawsuit, which is seen as an unprecedented attempt to establish that literacy is a U.S. constitutional right under the 14th Amendment, is being closely watched by education, legal and civil rights experts with some saying it could make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Novi man accused of espionage awaits trial in Russia

A trial is expected in early 2020 for a Novi man who has spent more than a year in a Russian prison on spying charges. Paul Whelan, 49, was arrested Dec. 28, 2018, in a Moscow hotel room and charged with espionage. His family has said he was in Russia for a friend’s wedding.

During a Christmas Eve detention hearing, a Moscow court ordered Whelan to remain behind bars. Russian authorities won't consider releasing him until after his trial, which could be held in March, at the earliest, according to his lawyers. Whelan's defense team has argued he was framed and had no knowledge of the classified data on a flash drive he was handed as part of the alleged setup.

In October, the U.S. House unanimously approved a resolution urging Russia to produce “credible” evidence against Whelan or “immediately” release him. Whelan's employer, automotive parts supplier BorgWarner, recently confirmed that his job in Michigan has been eliminated. Whelan's family and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have raised concerns about his declining health due to a hernia, as well as his treatment and isolation by authorities in Russia.

Young Tigers try to earn stripes

The Detroit Tigers say they’ve torn it all down. Now, we might this season get a chance to see what they’re building. Trades over the last three years have gutted the major-league roster, and it’s shown, as the Tigers have averaged 103 losses during that span. Those trades — as well as high first-round draft picks, thanks to the Tigers’ tailspin — have helped reseed a farm system left relatively barren as Detroit pushed for championships earlier in the decade.

That system could bear plenty of fruit in 2020. Of the Tigers' top 10 prospects, according to MLB Pipeline, seven are projected by the site to reach Comerica Park at some point next season, with an eighth (catcher Jake Rogers) having debuted last season. That includes top prospect and former No. 1 overall draft pick, right-hander Casey Mize. Tigers general manager Al Avila also brought in solid if not unspectacular free agents in second baseman Jonathan Schoop and first baseman C.J. Cron to add pop to a lineup that last season was sorely lacking.

The 2020 Tigers won’t be ready to contend in the American League Central, to be sure, and very likely won’t even be ready to flirt with .500, but they could be better than last season’s 114-loss edition, giving fans a little hope for the present, and the future.

Plans for the $830 million Monroe Blocks project in downtown Detroit, seen in a courtyard view in this rendering, include more than an acre of open space.

Developments to progress downtown

For downtown development, 2020 will be a year of waiting for key details on several of the most ambitious real estate plans in the central business district.

Another question is the status of real estate mogul Dan Gilbert, who has been recuperating since he suffered a stroke in May, and the future structure of his Bedrock development group.

Construction of the estimated $1 billion Hudson's project — a ""city within a city"" as once described by Bedrock officials — will keep going in 2020. Completion date is 2023. In 2020, it's possible the developer will decide whether the project will include the city's tallest building.

At another Bedrock development, construction work of the estimated $830 million Monroe Blocks project, was slowed in 2019. More updates are expected in 2020.

Joe Louis Arena will become history in 2020; its demolition will be completed. What happens to the riverfront property is unclear. In fall 2019, Detroit-based Sterling Group said it wanted to buy the former arena and adjacent parking garage for $14.1 million. Under the proposed deal, the group may take up to five years to figure out what to do with the property.

Sometime in the early to middle of 2020, more specifics should be unveiled on the estimated $750 million plan for the University of Michigan's ""Detroit Center for Innovation."" The development planned for at ""failed jail"" site on the edge of Greektown. The development would be anchored by the $300 million research and graduate education building for UM students.

A revised blight bond plan

A new proposal to wipe out blight is anticipated from Detroit's administration in 2020 after City Council in November rejected Mayor Mike Duggan's plan to put a $250 million bond before voters to fund it.

The council's 6-3 vote against putting a 30-year bond before voters in March left the future path for tearing down tens of thousands of abandoned homes up in the air. The vote came as Detroit's auditor general released a critical report of city-funded demolition work, citing unreliable data and documentation.

Duggan has said he respected the council's decision and vowed to forge ahead on a plan that both sides can agree on.

Detroit has brought down nearly 20,000 houses since 2014, primarily with federally funds. But the program fell under scrutiny over bidding concerns and soaring costs and has since become the subject of local, state and federal reviews and investigations.

Michigan, Michigan State try to shake funk

The Michigan and Michigan State football programs will enter the 2020 season coming off the same-old, same-old. The Wolverines still haven’t reached a Big Ten title game under Jim Harbaugh and still can’t beat archrival Ohio State. The Spartans, meanwhile, still appear mired in mediocrity, coming off another seven-win season.

The program’s relative shortcomings fall on the shoulders of their coaches. Harbaugh returned to his old stomping grounds five years ago, tasked with helping the Wolverines regain a foothold with their rivals and the national landscape. And, while Harbaugh appears to have the upper hand on Michigan State, the drought against Ohio State (dating to 2011) and in the Big Ten (dating to 2004) persist. MSU head coach Mark Dantonio, on the other hand, has won Big Ten titles (three) but is 27-24 in the last four seasons while wading through plenty of off-the-field controversy, fueling talk of his future in East Lansing. Will 2020 be the season Dantonio finally returns, and will it be the season Harbaugh finally arrives?

The Lions and quarterback Matthew Stafford are 3-5-1, and appear to be headed to another season without a playoff appearance.

Decision time for Lions?

It just might be now or never for Lions general manager Bob Quinn and head coach Matt Patricia. Detroit’s 3-12-1 season — capped by a nine-game losing streak — has the spotlight squarely on the duo. Owner Martha Ford already has said Quinn and Patricia will be back in 2020, but expectations are clear: “We expect to be a playoff contender, and those are our expectations, which we’ve expressed to both Bob and to Matt,” she said in December.

The Lions — 9-22-1 in two seasons under Patricia — will be armed with the No. 3 overall pick in next April’s NFL Draft. They were in just about every game this season, holding leads in 14 of 16 games, despite a roster ravaged by injuries. Still, a turnaround will be a tall task for a franchise that hasn’t won a division title since 1994, and hasn’t won a playoff game since 1991.

New downtown, suburban eateries

When it comes to new restaurants in 2020, Detroit will continue to open its arms to a range of styles and cuisines from some renowned chefs. Two of the most anticipated set to open their doors in the new year are Freya and Dragonfly in the city’s Milwaukee Junction neighborhood. Chartreuse Kitchen and Cocktails owner Sandy Levine and chef Doug Hewitt are planning a dual concept with a chef-driven tasting menu at Freya, while Dragonfly will be a more casual space with an interesting bar including low-alcohol and no-alcohol cocktails.

There will also be a few big expansions — the famed Bucharest Grill will opens its first suburban location in Royal Oak’s Woodward Corners development — and some notable re-openings. Founders Brewing Company, which shut down at the end of 2019 after weeks of controversy stemming from a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by an ex-employee, is expected to reopen its Detroit taproom in early 2020.

In May, Marvel’s “Black Widow” hits the big screen. “Respect,” the Aretha Franklin biopic starring Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson, will hit theaters on Oct. 9.

Designed by world-renowned Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf, the garden in front of the Nancy Brown Peace Carillon Tower was supposed to have its first major planting in fall 2019, but it had to be pushed back because of high water levels. The first planting will now likely happen in 2020 and is expected to draw volunteers from all over the world.","2020 Outlook: Seven state issues to watch over 7 monthsBOSTON — There are 213 days between New Year's Day and July 31, the final day for formal legislating in 2020. In that time, Massachusetts lawmakers hope to tackle what's left on their 2019-2020 session to-do lists, in addition to whatever else crops up unexpectedly as the session wears on.

The House and Senate took care of some items on the agendas that Democratic leaders sketched out last winter (Gov. Charlie Baker, too), but a number of heady issues remain unaddressed with seven months until the real work ends and campaign season really picks up.

Seven months from the finish line, here's a look at seven major issues to watch during the second half of the 191st General Court, which officially kicks off with light sessions on New Year's Day morning. Whether or not the Legislature makes significant progress on these topics, they will be key factors in the final analysis of the two-year session's accomplishments:

1) Transportation Revenue

All eyes are on the House in the new year as members prepare to take up a transportation revenue debate they delayed from the fall.

Key lawmakers have hinted an increase in the state's 24-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax will likely be a part of the package, but other proposals from higher fees on ride-hailing services to expanded roadway tolling may also be included in the bill. Any increase to the gas tax would be the first in Massachusetts since 2013. That history will hang over the next round of action: lawmakers raised the tax 3 cents and indexed it to increase alongside inflation, but voters repealed the latter half through a ballot question one year later.

While the House prepares for the debate — no bill has been unveiled yet, but Speaker Robert DeLeo said he is aiming for a vote in January — Senate leaders have not shown their hand.

President Karen Spilka has not yet committed to taking up the topic of transportation revenues in 2020, and the upper chamber's Transportation Committee chair, Sen. Joseph Boncore, said he expects any consideration to come after an informal transportation working group finishes its work at an undetermined time.

Gov. Charlie Baker, meanwhile, has already outlined his opposition to any gas tax increase and to congestion pricing, a strategy of altering roadway tolls at different times of day that many transportation advocates back. Pressure has been growing on lawmakers to address the state's wide-ranging transportation needs, particularly after a string of developments in 2019. The Baker administration's study on roadway congestion concluded that already-bad traffic conditions are getting worse.

A June derailment on the Red Line damaged aging MBTA infrastructure and created months of commuter headaches. An outside panel tapped in the wake of that incident concluded that T leaders have not prioritized safety culture, partly because of an overemphasis on reducing a repeated operating budget deficit while also pursuing capital investment. With Baker asserting the state already has enough revenue to tackle transportation needs, Democrats face pressure to work across branches to make sure they have the votes to overcome any vetoes, as well as the challenge of coming up with a plan that the electorate supports and which won't come back to haunt lawmakers when their names are up for re-election in November.

2) Climate Change

Eighty-one state lawmakers rang in 2019 by resolving to pursue a suite of climate policies, including moving the state to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The year brought youth climate strikes and clean energy pushes from municipal and business leaders but not, ultimately, completed climate legislation. The Senate is eyeing action in early 2020 on a bill that its Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee chairman, Sen. Michael Barrett, has suggested will address clean energy along with emissions from vehicles and buildings.

Sen. Marc Pacheco, who chairs the Senate Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change, has been beating the drum for action in that branch.

The House, which passed a $1.3 billion borrowing bill in July to support municipal resiliency and adaptation projects, hasn't indicated if its members and leadership plan to embark on other efforts to produce and pass major climate legislation. The House's so-called GreenWorks bill, a priority of Speaker DeLeo's, has been sitting since its unanimous passage before the Senate Bonding Committee, chaired by Sen. Michael Moore of Millbury.

If a climate debate occurs in 2020, it will take place as South Shore residents and many elected officials continue to oppose the construction of a natural gas compressor station in Weymouth and as Massachusetts works with other states to build a regional cap-and-invest program aimed at cutting transportation emissions. The debate at the State House over actions that can be taken mostly within the state's borders comes amidst reports of progress, and setbacks, in the global effort to reduce emissions that scientists say are fueling climate change and rising sea levels.

3) Housing

In November 2018, eight months after the Housing Committee first endorsed Gov. Baker's proposal to lower the local voting threshold for zoning changes, its co-chair Rep. Kevin Honan said the bill would come up ""early in the next session.""

A full year came and went with no action to advance Baker's bill — or any other major housing production legislation — until the committee again favorably recommended it as part of a mid-December 2019 package.

As 2020 arrives, the push for action on housing now shifts to the two Ways and Means Committees and the Democrats that control them. The housing market in Massachusetts remains strained even after a $1.8 billion housing bond bill enacted in 2018, with the median home sale price up to $400,000 through October and report after report identifying a need for tens of thousands more units than the state currently has to offer.

Baker's bill is not the only tool lawmakers can consider to address the challenge: the Housing Committee also advanced legislation to establish a statewide target of 427,000 new housing units by 2040, to require multi-family housing by right in MBTA communities, to increase residential density and more.

In late January, the committee also plans to hear testimony on a push to revive local options for rent control, which was in place in three communities until a landlord-backed statewide ballot question banned the practice in 1994.

""The housing crisis has moved into the middle class and is creeping up beyond the middle class,"" Rep. Nika Elugardo warned at an October rally in favor of her tenant protection legislation. ""Now that so-called 'everyday people' are experiencing the pain of the housing crisis, people are beginning to question how we do business around here.""

4) Health Care

After whiffing on a major health care reform last session, lawmakers have been slow to move on the renewed attempt they promised — and there are no indications that the House, Senate and governor are even on the same page when it comes to health care. Gov. Baker rolled out his plan to address costs and quality in October, but the Democrats who control the Legislature gave it a mostly cool reception.

Rep. Jennifer Benson, chair of the Health Care Financing Committee, had been leading the House's latest attempt to rein in health care costs and stabilize the marketplace, but she just announced she's got a new job and will be resigning in early January. Speaker DeLeo hasn't indicated who his new health care point person will be, or whether the House intends to make health care a central part of its work over the next few months. The Senate's plan, while not crystal clear, is a bit more evident.

Senate President Spilka said in October that senators had been working ""for months now"" to craft health care legislation, with Health Care Financing chair Sen. Cindy Friedman and Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery chair Sen. Julian Cyr leading the effort. The Senate already passed a bill dealing specifically with prescription drug prices, and Spilka has suggested that her branch will address the issue in pieces rather than with one comprehensive bill, a strategy that could complicate things with the House.

""I don't think any one bill can do it all,"" she said in October. Asked about the Senate's timeline for a health care bill, Spilka said, ""when it's ready ... and we will see if we do it in parts or in whole.""

5) Sports Betting/Gaming

At one point after the U.S. Supreme Court granted states the right to legalize sports betting, Massachusetts looked like it could be among the early adopters.

The state's casinos, which aren't quite living up to their revenue projections, are eager for a new way to attract gamblers and Bay State sharps are looking forward to placing a bet without having to drive across state lines. But as other states raced forward — New Hampshire this week joined Rhode Island in accepting wagers — the issue has moved to the back burner on Beacon Hill.

Led by Sen. Eric Lesser and Rep. Ann-Margaret Ferrante, the Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technology has been weighing the myriad issues that could come with a further expansion of gambling in Massachusetts.

""It is an issue that has potentially broad social consequences, so it has to be done deliberately and properly,"" Lesser told the News Service in December.

On top of the sports betting-specific questions the committee must answer — how should wagers or winnings be taxed? Should college sports be open to betting? How accessible should betting platforms be? — lawmakers have previously suggested they might address a more comprehensive scope of the gaming universe, including sports betting, daily fantasy sports and other forms of gaming and wagering, with legislation in the spring of 2020.

Gov. Baker, who filed his own sports betting bill in January 2019 in hopes that people could bet by the start of the NFL season, has said he doesn't anticipate much from the Legislature until the session is nearly complete. ""The session ends in July, but I would be very surprised if it got done before that,"" he said in October on WEEI.

6) Budgeting/Education Bill Implementation

Gov. Baker has until Jan. 22 to file his fiscal 2021 budget, a spending plan that will incorporate a newly lowered income tax rate of 5 percent.

Next year's budget will be the first to feature the substantial new spending called for under the new education funding law, and advocates' eyes will be on how well the governor and lawmakers, especially Ways and Means chairs Sen. Michael Rodrigues and Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, can live up to the $1.5 billion, seven-year commitment without carving up other budget priorities.

The law has no dedicated revenue source. Baker has characterized the investment as ""a stretch on a $40 billion budget,"" but ""not that big a stretch"" on an incremental basis. ""I certainly think what this means for us and for the Legislature on a go-forward basis, this is going to have to be sort of first-in when we make decisions about what the budget looks like,"" he said in November.

With revenue growth projected to be much slower than in recent years, pouring money into K-12 education could squeeze other priorities.

A tax revenue estimate developed by Michlewitz, Rodrigues and the administration is due by Jan. 15 and will shed light on how much the budget chiefs expect the fiscal picture to tighten in 2020. Flush with cash the past two years, the Massachusetts Legislature has still been the last in the country to finalize an annual budget, and a dispute this fall over a bill to allocate the fiscal 2019 surplus dragged for months.

It remains to be seen how Michlewitz and Rodrigues will lead in a slowdown, but Rodrigues said in December he's confident the state will have enough money to meet its needs. ""It's still growth,"" he said. ""I've been around long enough that I've been here when there's been shrinkage, and we're not moving in that direction.""

7) Jobs Bill

It's an even-numbered year, so chances are good that legislators will tackle an economic development/job creation bill before turning their attention to their re-election campaigns.

In mid-December, Gov. Baker unveiled and signed his administration's updated economic development plan and laid the groundwork for an economic development borrowing bill worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""We'll file it shortly after the beginning of the new year,"" Baker said Dec. 13. ""Our hope is that we get an early hearing and ... they will pass something that looks like the legislation that will enable the implementation of this plan.""

Once a bill is filed, the next steps will likely be up to the Economic Development Committee and co-chairs Ferrante and Lesser, each of whom has issued a statement reflecting their interest in passing a bill. With unemployment below 3 percent, the Massachusetts economy contracted in the third quarter largely due to constraints on the labor force that are holding back growth, economists said.

Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito put it this way: ""We need to be a little selfish about the talent that we have here. We want to keep it here.""

The Baker administration signals in its plan that it intends to focus on the cost of doing business over the next three years, a message that the business community will welcome but which could run into obstacles in the Legislature. The plan also calls for steps to build on the growth in life sciences, advanced manufacturing, defense, and health care sectors and ""aims to leverage emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and robotics.""","Or not.Only 5% of third-grade students would have been held back under the new scoring system had it been applied to 2019 scores.Cron to add pop to a lineup that last season was sorely lacking.Will 2020 be the season Dantonio finally returns, and will it be the season Harbaugh finally arrives?Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" coming to movie theaters in June.","2020 Outlook: Seven state issues to watch over 7 monthsBOSTON — There are 213 days between New Year's Day and July 31, the final day for formal legislating in 2020.Sen.

George Mason National Memorial

(Image by Tim Evanson) Details DMCA



This government will set out a moderate Aristocracy: it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will in its operation produce a Monarchy, or a corrupt tyrannical --Aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other ... George Mason's Objections to the Proposed Federal Constitution, June 18, 1788.

We the ""people"" now have the opportunity and the duty to prove Mr. Mason wrong. An impartial presidential impeachment trial now might well lead us toward a more honest, responsive body of civil officers and possibly even a less militaristic foreign policy. This is the first of a series of articles dealing with the flaws in our present impeachment trial system and the actions we might take to improve it before it is next called into use. In considering our present duty regarding impeachment, we can benefit from the words of James Madison, sometimes called the ""Father"" of our Constitution. He wrote on Oct. 15, 1788 (thirteen months into ratification) ""The great desiderata on a Court of Impeachment are 1. Impartiality, 2. Respectability (credibility): the first in order to a right the second in order to a satisfactory decision... James Madison, Observations on Jefferson's Draft of a Constitution for Virginia

This article first looks at democracy through the words of a philosopher. Next it quotes three prominent framers on impeachment. Then it comments on the political nature of our two presidential impeachment trials. Finally, it suggests the use of The Senate Impeachment Rules as the means of securing an impartial trial in 2020. Subsequent articles will suggest specific changes in the Senate Rules'

A Philosopher's Comment on Democracy

The 17th C. French Philosopher (and mentor to James Madison) Baron Charles de Montesquieu believed that the democratic form of government has an ""Inherent"" weakness in that it gives to its people the final power over their government (on ""parchment""), but fails to give them an effective way to control their civil officers. According to de Montesquieu, Kings control their civil officers by rewarding loyalty with titles. Dictators control theirs by punishing disloyalty with death. Perhaps the Framers of our democracy intended to put us, the people, in the places of kings and dictators. Instead, however, they gave us abstractions and ""parchment."" The people of democracies have their power in name only. The coming impeachment trial gives us another opportunity to devise a remedy to what de Montesquieu called democracy's ""inherent weakness:"" the great difficulty of creating a body of honest civil officers dedicated to our (the people's), even more than their own, best interests.

Hamilton on Impeachment

Hamilton submitted a statement of ""principles"" on Monday, June 18, 1787 (about three weeks after the Convention began). It read, in part, ""The Governour, Senators and all officers of the United States to be liable to impeachment for mal and corrupt conduct and, upon conviction, to be removed from office and disqualified for holding any office of trust or profit - - - all impeachments to be tried by a court to consist of the Chief . . . or Judge of the superior Court of Law of each State. Between June and September, he changed his mind about the judiciary. During the last few days of the Convention, he proposed (and secured approval of) the Senate as the trier of impeachments. During the ratification period, Hamilton published Federalist 65 and 66 supporting the Senate as the trier of impeachments.

Madison on Impeachment

Madison quoted de Montesquieu in Federalist No. 47 and elsewhere. He evidently took de Montesquieu's warnings seriously when the Baron wrote about (1) the dangers of mixing the powers of government and (2) the ""inherent"" weakness of democracies. He must have regarded Hamilton's insistence on the Senate as the trier of impeachments as a double blunder. It both violated the separation of powers principle and missed an opportunity to strengthen the impeachment provisions in response to de Montesquieu's criticism of democracies. Madison opposed Senate impeachment trials from the first to the last days of the Convention. James Madison's Notes of the Constitutional Convention for Sept. 8 (The Convention ended on Sept.16th) read, in part. ""Mr. Madison objected to a trial of the President by the Senate, especially as he was to be impeached by the other branch of the legislature . . . He would prefer the Supreme Court for the trial of impeachments, or rather a Tribunal of which that should form a part"".

Monroe on Impeachment

Our 5th President, James Monroe, writing during the five years between the end of his second term and his death, was optimistic about the ability of our impeachment provisions to maintain an honest body of civil officers. He wrote, in The People The Sovereigns (p. 16): ""The right of impeachment and of trial by the legislature is the mainspring of the great machine of government. . . If preserved in full vigor and exercised with perfect integrity, every branch will perform its duty and the people will perform theirs."" The willingness of Monroe and Hamilton to entrust impeachment trials to the legislative branch may be explained, in part, by their taking a monarchy (England) as their model.

Our Constitution and Impeachment

The reports of our two presidential trials indicate that our Constitution's presidential impeachment system is malfunctioning in a serious way. That is, it is functioning politically spite the fact that our senators and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are sworn to make it function impartially. In large part because of this failure, it has also been a dismal failure at discouraging presidential violations of our Constitution. It is impossible to say how much of our present government's chaos is due to the failure of the impeachment provisions. We do know, however, that our framers relied on them to motivate the civil officers of the three branches to dedicate themselves to our interests above their own. We also know that the Americans of the 18th C. could not anticipate the two-party system or the 17th Amendment of 1913. If they had, it seems unlikely that they would have trusted the Senate to vote impartially..

Frick on The Philalèthes Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philalèthes | No Comments The following sketch is translated from Karl R. H. Frick’s Die Erleuchteten: Gnostisch-theosophische und alchemistisch-rosenkreuzerische Geheimgesellschaften bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts, ein Beitrag zur Geistesgeschichte der Neuzeit (1973), p. 574 ff., originally included as an appendix at the end of McBean and Gabirro, A Complete History Of The Ancient And Primitive Rite (2002). There were a few mistakes with spelling and grammar, etc., so I’ve cleaned it up, while providing annotations, links and illustrations. In regard to the entire milieu of high-grade Freemasonry during the Enlightenment, the Philalèthes are as noteworthy as they come. The Rite itself - more of a regime - and the Lodge ‘Amis Réunis’ from which it was founded, constituted a clearing house for all things occult or esoteric on the continent and beyond; Savalette de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebien may even be described as engaging in Masonic espionage. There isn’t a single volume on 18th Century Freemasonry that doesn’t give the major details of the Amis Réunis and the Philalèthes. Members of the rite came not only from France, but from Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Sweden and Russia (and as was shown with the publishing of J. J. C. Bode’s diary in 1994, the Bavarian Illuminati had managed to officially join forces with it just two years before the revolution). I’ve read more than a few accounts of the Philalèthes over the years, but this report by Frick - about as complete an introduction as as you’ll find - is by far the best. *** › Continue reading

Lodge of Les Amis Réunis [The United Friends] Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philalèthes | 2 Comments We’ll be mentioning this famous Lodge in Paris in forthcoming posts. What follows is a concise explanation of its operation and makeup (translated from a French Masonic Encyclopedia entry by Pierre François Pinaud). *** Amis Réunis From 1771 to 1791, this lodge was one of the most prestigious in Paris and was consecrated by the Keeper of the Royal Treasury Savalette de Langes. Initially formed abroad in Rumigny, a small town of Thiérache, by a magistrate of the Parliament of Paris (banished by Chancellor Maupeou), in 1773 the lodge settled permanently in Paris. Savalette de Langes had made the inner circle of the Amis Réunis the social center of modern Freemasonry and cosmopolitanism of the late Enlightenment. Here the elite and and the talented joined together. The orchestra of the Amis Réunis was composed of six musicians of renown, like the composer [Isidore] Bertheaume, the brothers Blasius, the King’s violinists, Boutray of the l’Académie [Royale] de Musique, and either the brothers Breval or Louis Francoeur, the King’s Superintendent of Music. The Lodge utilized a large space in a house in the Rue Popincourt, built in 1708 by the architect Dulin for the supplier of arms [Nicholas?] Dunoyer. Upon his death in 1791, Les Amis Réunis counted some 300 members with a further 37 casual brothers and brother servants. It comprised about 12% foreigners, such as the Baron de Beutz, chancellor of Saxony; the Baron de Gleichen, Minister of Denmark in Madrid, Naples and Paris; and Count Stroganoff, a Russian subject. A hundred senior officers or generals decorate the pillars, and about fifteen of their regiment. Painters and sculptors are well represented with a dozen doctors, all members of the Academy of Medicine or professors at the University of Paris - Monge was an assiduous member of the lodge for some years. But the Amis Réunis’ uniqueness is the significant number of its members who belonged to the world of finance: 37% of the Lodge in total, 84 people, were indeed financiers. We count no fewer than 15 bankers or speculators, 13 receiver generals, 7 tax collectors [fermiers généraux], 7 general treasurers including those of the Navy and War, 4 general paymasters, 19 members of the Courts of Finances of Paris, 7 senior officials of the Royal treasury and finally, 11 brothers who were occupied with public finance. On the eve of the Revolution, the lodge of the Amis Réunis had the highest concentration of financiers; a number of them met in groups, or independently, to engage in speculative ventures. We also find Lodge members as shareholders of the arms factory in Charleville, the Water Company in Paris, and the mines at Baïgorry, Decize or Rueil. Another group actively participated in speculation about the dollars held by the bank St. Charles de Madrid. Others are shareholders of the Hudson Bay Company that traded with Canada. Many specialize in international commerce, and others with India or the islands trading sugar and rum, but also the slave trade. At the famous East India Company, one finds Lodge members as shareholders or as administrators. A last group is actively involved in real estate speculation in Paris. The success of the Amis Réunis in the financial world may be explained by the fact that, in the latter third of the 18th-century, in the absence of public credit, only powerful financiers could undertake large scale financial transactions. Everything is then prefaced upon trust. This leads to the membership of professional lobbyists, and familial networks which are found in the Lodge. The trustworthiness of Masonic affiliation may result in more business, which enables both administrators and profiteers. The Lodge therefore offered a discreet setting for financial conversations and the development of protective relationships; philosophical bonds are then the natural extension in the world of finance.

The So-Called Schwedenkiste (“Swedish Box”), the Most Significant Illuminati Archive Wednesday, June 17th, 2009 | Primary Documents | 7 Comments by Terry Melanson (17/6/2009) After Adam Weishaupt had fled in 1785, the center of activity for the Illuminati shifted from Bavaria to the Duchies of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar. And while the founder of the Illuminati was content to safely settle down for the long haul at the court of Duke Ernst II of Saxe Gotha, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793) took the reins and assumed the role previously held by Weishaupt. Through the efforts of Bode and an expanding network of recruits – and under the protection of the Illuminati Dukes Karl August of Saxe-Weimar and Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha – new colonies were established in places like France, Russia and Italy. Bode kept the Weimar and Gotha Lodges Amalia and Ernst Zum Kompass informed of his activities, but the bulk of the evidence of continued Illuminati activity remained in his possession. Ensuring that whatever they contained would remain secret, upon Bode’s death in December 1793 his literary executor, Illuminatus Christian Gottlieb von Voigt (1743–1819), transferred his deceased friend’s possessions to Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha who had already bought the voluminous papers before Bode died. › Continue reading

“Master Conspiracy” Redux Monday, June 15th, 2009 | Illuminati myths | 9 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/6/2009) The New American website has posted a slightly redacted version of William H. McIlhany’s 1996 article which appeared in the September 16, 1996 issue of The New American. (The original can be read here, which, in turn, appears to be based on one of McIlhany’s presentations). I first became aware of McIlhany’s writings on the Illuminati in 2000. At the time I was very impressed by what I read, and immediately realized that his information on the real Bavarian Illuminati was more thorough than most. However, my own knowledge on the subject is a bit more advanced than it was some nine years ago. So with that in mind, here are some exaggerations and/or misrepresentations which struck me as I reread the article at The New American for the first time in years. “Kölmer” and the Origin of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of the Illuminati According to McIlhany, Weishaupt was “instructed by a mysterious occultist named Kölmer.” The only problem I have with this statement is that it is not qualified with “alleged” or “purported.” The Kölmer legend first appeared in Volume III of Abbé Augustin Barruel’s tome against Philosophes, Freemasons, the Illuminati and the Jacobins. He related it rather tentatively as a rumour going round, and as a possible way of explaining the ostensibly advanced nature of Weishaupt’s mysteries. › Continue reading

“Lang” or “Lanz”: Myths about the “Myths” Saturday, November 15th, 2008 | Illuminati myths | 4 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/11/2008) So, I’m browsing through the results of a keyword-search (targeting blogs) that I had previously saved as an RSS feed in Google Reader - “Illuminati.” Usually the results point to sites that abuse the term as a mere descriptor for an overarching, all-powerful monolithic conspiracy. However, once in a while, I occasionally come across at least an attempt not to knowingly butcher the historical record. The November 12th post at the English section of Illuminaten.org is one such example. But as I started reading “The Bavarian Illuminati: several myths revealed,” it became quite clear that the post is, in fact - word for word - an abridged re-posting of “A Bavarian Illuminati Primer.” Once I got to the part about Lanz and Lang, I knew for sure. Here’s what Mason Trevor W. McKeown thinks is the myth/truth: As an example of the mythology that surrounds the history of the Illuminati, note that Barruel claimed that Lanz, an Illuminati courier and apostate priest, was struck by lightning, thus revealing Weishaupt’s papers to the authorities, but this does not appear to be substantiated. This error was widely reprinted and enlarged on by subsequent anti-masons whose lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy has lead them to confuse Johann Jakob Lanz (d.1785), a non-Illuminati secular priest in Erding, and friend of Weishaupt, with Franz Georg Lang, a court advisor in Eichstätt who was active in the Illuminati under the name Tamerlan. Barruel mistakenly translated “weltpriester”, or secular priest, as apostate priest and subsequent writers such as Webster and Miller have repeated this error. Eckert renamed Weishaupt’s friend as Lanze and had him struck by lightning while carrying dispatches in Silesia. Miller cited Eckert but renamed Lanz as Jacob Lang and placed the lightning strike in Ratisbon. This is a minor detail in the history but it demonstrates the lack of accuracy often displayed by detractors of the Illuminati. As nobody has challenged him on these assertions - not even a German site who should know better - I’ll reiterate and add additional information to what I had written back in August 2005. Mr. McKeown is guilty of the same thing he accuses others of: “lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy.” › Continue reading

Illuminati Sightseeing: Karl and St. Germain at Louisenlund Monday, November 10th, 2008 | Illuminati Sightseeing | 2 Comments by Terry Melanson (10/11/2008) The estate of (Illuminatus) Landgrave Karl von Hessen-Kassel (1744-1836) was an occult-masonic initiatory retreat. The world’s foremost expert on the 18th-Century Golden and Rosy Cross, Dr. Christopher McIntosh: The head of the Asiatic Brethren in the 1780s and 1790s was the Landgrave Carl von Hessen-Kassel, one of the most fascinating and influential figures at the time in the world of Masonry, Rosicrucianism and hermetic studies. He not only belonged to innumerable orders and rites, but he was a practicing alchemist and was a friend of the mysterious French alchemist, the Comte de St. Germain, whom he harbored during the last years of St. Germain’s life on his estate Louisenlund in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, which he turned into a great center of Masonic and esoteric activity. The park at Louisenlund (about an hour’s drive northwest of Kiel) was laid out in the form of an initiatic journey that involved the candidate passing through a dense wood finding his way through a labyrinth and encountering various alchemical and allegorical images along the way. In the park was an alchemist’s tower with a laboratory and a room where Masonic rituals were conducted. There was also a pond with a secret grotto concealed behind a waterfall, in which the most solemn rituals were held. Over the years, unfortunately, most of these symbolic features have disappeared. All that remains of the alchemist’s tower, for example, is this Egyptian stone doorway which was moved to a different position, and cemented into the wall of a stable building where it stands completely out of context. Today this property belongs to a private school. › Continue reading","Respectability (credibility): the first in order to a right the second in order to a satisfactory decision...

en,en,1484188852_1483860208,3.5,3.5,2,3.5,4,2.5,2.5,"Call for Civil War to be remembered with memorial to all victimsA memorial to all those who died in the Civil War is under consideration by the group set up to advise the Government on commemorations.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 people - the exact figure has never been determined - died in the short, but vicious Civil War between June 1922 and May 1923 which followed the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

Despite its seminal importance in the history of the State, there is no national memorial to commemorate the war.

Dr Maurice Manning, the chair of the Government’s expert advisory group on commemorations, said the group have discussed a permanent memorial.

Dr Manning said the most obvious option is to rededicate the cenotaph on the lawn of Leinster House to all the victims of the Civil War. It is currently dedicated to the memory of Arthur Griffth, Michael Collins and Kevin O’Higgins, three of the most prominent pro-Treaty politicians.

However, the memorial is within the grounds of Leinster House and is not open to the public.

Dr Manning said the group is open to consideration for a public memorial either there or in a different place.

“I’m keen that there be a public debate on this. What form should the memorial take? We should have a debate if the Leinster Lawn is suitable or some other place. I think it is much more practical to think anew,” he suggested.

“Is it a good idea to commission a permanent memorial to all those who died in the Civil War. The idea of a day of reconciliation is a good idea, but how do you structure it?”

Dr Manning said now is the right time to commemorate the Civil War as the bitterness had dissipated over the last almost 100 years.

In its guidance to the Government on the second half of the decade of centenarries, the advisory group recommended the State should take a “reflective and reconciliatory tone” in relation to the Civil War that recognises “neither side had the monopoly of either atrocity or virtue and this was true of words as well as actions.”

It said the silences that followed the Civil War could now be replaced by “meaningful engagements with a difficult and traumatic time”.

It went on to state the consequences of the actions on all sides, and the depth, sincerity, or sometimes anger and sense of retribution underpinning those actions, needs to be confronted as part of any meaningful commemoration.”","Mississippi Wants Court Redo of 15-Week Abortion Ban ChallengeMississippi is asking the entire Fifth Circuit to reconsider striking down a law that prohibits previability abortions after a fetus reaches 15 weeks’ gestation.

Bans on abortions that take place before a fetus is capable of living outside the womb “are unconstitutional regardless of the State’s interests,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said.

It said the silences that followed the Civil War could now be replaced by “meaningful engagements with a difficult and traumatic time”.It went on to state the consequences of the actions on all sides, and the depth, sincerity, or sometimes anger and sense of retribution underpinning those actions, needs to be confronted as part of any meaningful commemoration.”","Mississippi Wants Court Redo of 15-Week Abortion Ban ChallengeMississippi is asking the entire Fifth Circuit to reconsider striking down a law that prohibits previability abortions after a fetus reaches 15 weeks’ gestation.A three-judge panel upheld a ruling invalidating the state law in mid-December.Bans on abortions that take place before a fetus is capable of living outside the womb “are unconstitutional regardless of the State’s interests,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said.States may regulate abortion so long as the regulation doesn’t impose an undue burden on women’s rights, but they may not ban previability abortions, the court said.Mississippi’s law is a...",,

The most recent case of revolving-door justice came Saturday morning, with the release, with no bail, of a woman charged with punching and cursing at three Orthodox women, ages 22, 26 and 31, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn at dawn the day before.

The accused assailant, Tiffany Harris, was hauled in handcuffs before a Brooklyn judge on 21 menacing, harassment and attempted assault charges.

“F-U, Jews!” Harris, 30, of Flatbush, allegedly shouted during the attack.

“Yes, I was there,” Harris later admitted to cops, according to the criminal complaint against her.

“Yes, I slapped them. I cursed them out. I said ‘F-U, Jews.”

As she stood before a judge in Brooklyn Criminal Court with the hood to a navy blue jacket over her head, Harris was in familiar territory.

She still has an open harassment and assault case on the Brooklyn docket from November 2018.

And last month, she was sentenced to no jail time for felony criminal mischief in Manhattan, court records show — a case for which she had repeatedly failed to make court appearances.

Brooklyn prosecutors didn’t even bother requesting bail Saturday, as they could have, given that the reform law, approved in April, technically doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1.

“The de Blasio administration has made it clear that we all need to get into compliance with bail reform now,” said a law enforcement source.

“If prosecutors had asked for bail, corrections would release them immediately,” or they would be sprung on Jan. 1, the source said.

Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Laura Johnson even made mention of the coming bail reform legislation in ordering Harris freed.

“So I’m releasing her on consent and also because it will be required under the statute in just a few days,” the judge said.

“Ms. Harris you’re being released on your own recognizance.”

She was issued an order of protection barring contact with the three victims — and a court date of Jan. 10.

Harris broke into a grin when approached by a reporter. “Why do you want to know?” she said. ”Goodbye.”

The legislation requires arraignment judges to set free suspects in any non-sexual assault that doesn’t actually cause a physical injury, even in cases of hate crime attacks.

“If there is an injury, then bail could be requested, because then it would be considered a violent felony,” explained Insha Rahman, who, as director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice, worked closely with legislators and the governor’s office in drafting the controversial reforms.

The no-injury loophole will mean a quick get-out-of-jail free card for all but one of the accused attackers in the eight Hanukkah-timed, anti-Semitic bias crimes that have terrified the city’s Orthodox communities.

“You have to beat the hell out of somebody — or murder them — for there to be any consequences,” said former state lawmaker Dov Hikind, founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism. “Otherwise, you are set free.”

He continued: “It’s open season in New York — open season on innocent people. On Jews, on Muslims, on gay people. It applies to anybody. But it’s the Jewish people in particular who have been targeted.”

Only one of last week’s eight attacks resulted in an actual physical injury — that of a 65-year-old Jewish man who was punched and kicked on Monday morning at East 41st Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan.

“F–k you, Jew bastard!” the petrified victim told cops his assailant shouted.

The suspect in that crime, Steven Jorge, 28, is indeed alleged to have injured his victim, and so was ordered locked up with no bail pending a psychological examination.

Jorge, though, is the exception.

On Friday night, a suspect in another of the hate attacks was similarly sprung with no bail, though in her case she was at least ordered to attend twice-monthly mental health appointments.

“You f—king Jew, the end is coming for you!” that suspect, Ayana Logan, 43, allegedly shouted as she swung a handbag at a 34-year-old Orthodox mom in Gravesend.

The mother had been holding the hand of her 3-year-old son when the unprovoked attack happened, according to the criminal court complaint against Logan.

By Saturday night, Logan, Harris, and Jorge remained the only suspects apprehended in the hate spree. The assailants in the remaining five attacks remain at large.

Rahman and other reformers argue that the vast majority of suspects in minor assaults are quickly released anyway — and that the new bail reform lets judges set conditions for release that can address the underlying mental-health issues.

“That can be mental health counseling, a stay-away order, which wasn’t readily available before, as conditions for release,” said Rahman.

Suspects are getting none of that during their pretrial stays in city jails, Rahman noted.

“Money bail, and keeping someone temporarily detained with no care, doesn’t address at all the long term concerns” of community safety and the well-being of suspects, she said.

But in the city’s Orthodox neighborhoods, there was outrage in learning that even when violent bigots are caught, they’ll be immediately released.

“They were released on bail?” a 32-year-old Orthodox man asked a Post reporter near where the three women were attacked. “Disgusting.”

Steve Benjamin, 30, of Borough Park, said, “We’re scared to walk at night in the street.

“There is a lot of hate here and I don’t know why. People in the community are scared. It’s very dangerous. It’s just like remembering the days before World War II. I don’t let my kids out alone.

“It should be more justice — they arrest them, but they let them out of jail a day later.”","Guardian Angels to patrol Jewish neighborhoods in New York City after recent attacksThe Guardian Angels, an unarmed crime-prevention group, said it would begin patrolling the New York City borough of Brooklyn on Sunday following a series of attacks against Jews.

At least five restaurants targeted have been in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties. Police are starting to believe the same group is behind all of the robberies.

Police are taking the men very seriously, because they are threatening to have guns while committing the crimes. New footage has been revealed that could bring investigators one step closer to catching the culprits.

In just the last few weeks the robberies have become more common. In some cases it’s two men making violent demands, escaping in a burgundy SUV and in other cases it’s one man acting alone and then fleeing on foot.

Robbery locations potentially connected:

Taco Bell in Livonia on Dec. 15

Fast Food restaurant in Independence Township on Dec. 21

Taco Bell in Milford on Dec. 25

Burger King in Auburn Hills on Dec. 27

Tim Horton’s in Roseville","VIDEO: Fast-Food Bandits Sought In Multiple Robberies Around Metro DetroitLIVONIA (WWJ) - The search is on for a group of robbers who have been targeting fast-food restaurants in Metro Detroit.

Over the past two weeks, at least four fast-food restaurants across the area have been robbed shortly after opening for business for the day and police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.

Livonia police say a single masked suspect robbed the Taco Bell on Merriman Road near Plymouth Road on December 15, implying he had a gun. A similar crime was reported at an unidentified fast-food restaurant in Independence Township on Dec. 21. Two masked suspects also robbed a Taco Bell restaurant in Milford on Dec. 24, as well as a Burger King restaurant in Auburn Hills on Dec. 27.

[VIDEO: Milford Taco Bell Robbed By Masked Men]

The suspects in the Livonia and Auburn Hills robberies were caught on surveillance videos fleeing in the same vehicle -- an older model maroon or red Ford Explorer with dark bottom trim and running boards. Witnesses also reported a vehicle matching the same description fleeing from the Milford robbery.

Security cameras captured images of the suspects, one of whom was carrying a blue backpack during the Milford and Auburn Hills robberies. The suspects are described as black males in their 20s, with hoods pulled up over their heads and their faces covered.

It's unclear how much cash the suspects took in the Livonia and Independence Township robberies, but they got about $200 from the Milford robbery. The employees in the Auburn Hills robbery refused to give the suspects money and said they were calling police, which sent the suspects running.

Below is an excerpt from the article.

Kleverness proudly bills its products as “the best, easiest and smartest solution for your home’s lighting.” I can categorically tell you that none of those claims are accurate, and that today Kleverness is not worth serious consideration if you want to outfit your home with smart lights.

The hockey puck-sized Klever Hub requires just the ethernet hookup and a power connection, and then you’re ready to connect via the Kleverness app to get things going. Or so I thought. After registering your name, email address, and a password with the app, you must wait for a confirmation code to be delivered via email before you can proceed. I registered and waited… and waited… and it wasn’t until nearly an hour later that my confirmation code finally arrived, after which time I had already created a new account with a different email address. This time the code landed in a spam folder, another aggravation.

The next step in setup is to scan a QR code on the underside of the Hub to register it to the app. I scanned, and the connection failed. I tried twice again, same result. After unplugging the Hub and plugging it back in, I tried a fourth time. The app crashed. The fifth try turned out to be the charm.

After a lengthy firmware update, I was finally ready to get started adding Kleverness components. Marketed as a smart lighting solution, Kleverness does not sell light bulbs. Instead, it sells an in-wall switch, an in-wall dimmer, and a plug-in outlet. The system’s goal is not to give you tunable lighting options but rather a way to control the lights you already have. Note that all this gear requires the Klever Hub to work.

It may come as no surprise to hear that the Kleverness app crashed over and over again when I was setting up these devices (more QR codes to be scanned), requiring multiple force-quits of the app and power cycling the Hub before I finally got anything to work. All told, I spent 2.5 hours working with the Kleverness system to get just one plug-in outlet working.

The front of the ensemble featured a tiger graphic. Its tail wound up her right strap, and it looked like it was getting ready to pounce. The swimsuit had a classic cut, with thick straps and a basic scoop-neckline.

Vanessa stood with her hands in her hair and her elbows out to her sides. At the same time, she bent her right knee slightly and looked into the distance to her left.

The So You Think You Can Dance judge had a flirty smile on her lips. She wore her hair up in a casual bun. Her accessories included a choker-style necklace, which she paired with a longer one. She also sported circular earrings but no bracelet.

The stunner stood in front of a fence beside a light-tiled wall. Beyond that were other buildings closer in, along with a steep hill that filled the entire frame. There were small cabins that dotted the background, with at least five visible in the shot. Towards the top of the frame, the scenery gave way to a forested area.

This picture was taken on a sunny day, which made for a bright backdrop. Vanessa, on the other hand, stood in the shadows. This meant that her makeup was hard to discern, although her dark lipstick popped in the shot.

In addition, a towel or robe hung on a black railing, which was presumably hers.

Fans headed to the comments section to gush about the bombshell.

“Ahhhh you did go! ENJOYYYY,” expressed model, Camila Coelho.

“You are perfect Happy new year! Love you forever,” raved an admirer.

Others were distracted by the snow.

“Just looking at this pic is making me freeze,” joked a fan.

“Omg your face looks so cozy but the snow talks about a different story,” wrote a fourth Instagram user.

In addition, the bombshell was spotted in another one-piece swimsuit last summer, on August 11. This time, it was a strapless and colorful number. There were bright yellow-and-white horizontal stripes. Vanessa wore a straw hat on her back and slung a matching bag on her left arm. The bag was arguably a little more eye-catching, as it featured black feather accents along the top. She glanced to her left and appeared to be mid-stride in shallow ocean waters. Behind her were multiple boats.","Kleverness proudly bills its products as “the best, easiest and smartest solution for your home’s lighting.” I can categorically tell you that none of those claims are accurate, and that today Kleverness is not worth serious consideration if you want to outfit your home with smart lights.Or so I thought.I scanned, and the connection failed.Note that all this gear requires the Klever Hub to work.It may come as no surprise to hear that the Kleverness app crashed over and over again when I was setting up these devices (more QR codes to be scanned), requiring multiple force-quits of the app and power cycling the Hub before I finally got anything to work.","In addition, a towel or robe hung on a black railing, which was presumably hers.Love you forever,” raved an admirer.Loading...

Here's a quick look at all that should grab the eyeballs from the world of entertainment in 2020.

Akshay Kumar

As of now, he has his eyes on two major festival dates, having lined up a big film on Eid as well as Diwali 2020. While he starts off his year on a regular Friday in March with ""Sooryavanshi"", Akshay looks set to go on collision with Salman Khan on Eid. While Salman has mentioned ""Radhe"" for the festival, the trade says Akshay plans to release ""Laxmmi Bomb"" on the same date. And although Diwali 2019 wasn't that great for ""Housefull 4"", he will be back on India's biggest festival this year with the historical drama ""Prithviraj"".

Ayushmann Khurrana

Having scored clear box-office winners that have also impressed critics over seven consecutive films now, any film starring Ayushmann automatically becomes a newsmaker. In 2020, he will play a gay character in ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" and also team up with Amitabh Bachchan in Shoojit Sircar's ""Gulabo Sitabo"". Looks like a surefire strategy to extend his strike rate to nine consecutive winners!

Social Media Superstars

These days, you don't necessarily need a film release to be popular. Ask Priyanka and Nick, Deepika and Ranveer, or Alia and Ranbir. In a nation obsessed with filmstars, the simple act of posting a picture on Instagram can guarantee much more mileage than the months of labour that shooting for a film entails. Sunny Leone, Shraddha Kapoor, and Sonam Kapoor continue to be darlings of the nation simply by intelligent utilisation of the power of social media, as do Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar.

The Heroine Oriented Films

Deepika Padukone in ""Chhapak"", Alia Bhatt in ""Gangubai Kathiawadi"", Kangana Ranaut in ""Panga"" and ""Thalaivi"", Kriti Sanon in ""Mimi"" and Kiara Advani in ""Indoo Ki Jawaani"" are but only a few heroine-centric films that will continue the wave of projects that present strong and authentic women to actresses and also celebrate the spirit of womanhood.

Ranveer Singh

With ""83"", Ranveer Singh aims at taking the biopic formula to the next level. He plays Kapil Dev, captain of the team that won the cricket World Cup for the first time in 1983. It was an epochal moment for Indian sports, and also a major boost to the spirit of nationalism. Director Kabir Khan should clinch a sureshot winner when the film releases on April 10.

Ranbir-Alia

Star couple Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt has always been in the news for some reason or the other. But 2020 will probably keep them in the news a little more than before. It is time, after all, for people to witness chemistry on screen, when ""Brahmastra"" releases.

Celebrity Weddings

Will Varun Dhawan tie the knot with girlfriend Natasha Dalal? Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt actually get married this year? And -- the question that never goes out of fashion -- will Salman Khan finally, finally tie the knot? If 2018 saw the weddings of Priyanka-Nick, Ranveer-Deepika and Sonam Kapoor-Anand Ahuja, then 2019 has been the year when rumours of romances sustained the gossip vine. Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor made their relationship public, while Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar's love grew stronger. Will 2020 see some power shaadis?

Bhatt's Union

Mahesh Bhatt will direct both daughters, Alia and Pooja, together in ""Sadak 2"" his return to direction for the first time two decades, since ""Zakhm"" in 1999. ""Sadak 2"" opens in July, 2020.

Comeback of Irrfan Khan

After fighting neuroendocrine tumour, Irrfan Khan is back in action. He will be on the big screen after almost three years in ""Angrezi Medium"", which is scheduled to release in March. Directed by Homi Adajania and co-starring Kareena Kapoor, the movie is a sequel to the multiplex hit, ""Hindi Medium"".

Small Films

Although most of Bollywood's biggest grossers at the box-office are still out-and-out commercial biggies (think ""War"", ""Dabangg 3"" or ""Kabir Singh""), the volume of the small, content-driven film has increased gradually over the years. In a multiplex-centric market, content is king, and modestly-mounted films such as ""Article 15"", ""Bala"" and ""Uri"" prove that fact. Small, content-driven fare will continue to dominate most Fridays in 2020, too.

Newcomers

Ex-Miss World Manushi Chillar makes her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in the mega-budget period drama ""Prithviraj"", while Shalini Pandey is Ranveer Singh's heroine in ""Jayeshbhai Jordaar"". National Award-winner Keerthi Suresh will be seen opposite Ajay Devgn in the sports drama ""Maidaan"". Krystle D'souza, who has made her mark on TV, makes her debut in the Amitabh Bachchan-Emraan Hashmi-starrer ""Chehre"". There are Bollywood's industry kids, too, lined up for debut. Sunil Shetty's son Ahan Shetty (""Tadap""), Chunky Pandey' son Ahan Pandey (project yet to be declared), Pooja Bedi's daughter Alaia F. (""Jawaani Jaaneman""), and Katrina Kaif's sister Isabelle Kaif (""Kwatha"") will be seen on the Hindi screen for the first time this year.

3D Back in Bollywood

This year, there are two films lined up, which will have 3D prints -- ""Street Dancer 3D"" and ""Tanhaji"". Although Bollywood has been trying time and again to come up with great 3D entertainment, budgetary constraints normally bar the creation of perfect entertainers in the expensive format. With evolving technology on their side, can 'Street Dancer"" and ""Tanhaji"" break the jinx?

Remixes and Recreations

Sadly, these will dominate the music scene, no matter what. We all know how obsessed Bollywood is now with remixes these days. The year of 2020 also seems to give the audience the same dose of recreations. Actor Saif Ali Khan is all set to give his fans some '90s nostalgia as he will be recreating his hit song ""Ole ole"" from movie ""Yeh Dillagi"". The revamped version, which has been composed by Tanishk Bagchi and sung by Yash Narvekar, will feature in Saif and Tabu-starrer upcoming film ""Jawaani Jaaneman"".

Non-Film Indian Music

Spearhedead by Punjabi pop stars, non-film music has become more robust than ever. If B Praak, Dhwani Bhanushali, Darshan Rawal, and The Doorbeens went from strength to strength, they will be back next year with many more new songs in the non-film genre, which has opened up again with the advent of growing streaming facilities. Even top Bollywood playback stars such as Arijit Singh and Neha Kakkar cannot resist getting into non-film mood once in a while.

Gal Gadot Returns as Wonder Woman

Gal Gadot will be back as Wonder Woman with edgier action for a new battle with new villains. The much-awaited ""Wonder Woman 1984"", a sequel of the megahit 2017 DC film, is one of the most anticipated films of 2020. The film, directed by Patty Jenkins, comes with tag line ""A new era of wonder begins"", and it will be interesting to watch what era will usher in with the movie. It is scheduled to open on June 5, 2020.

Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow

After years of anticipation, Marvel Studios will finally release a solo ""Black Widow"" movie, redefining the superhero universe with women power in focus. The film will bring back Scarlett Johansson in the avatar of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow as she traces her past to solve puzzle of her life. It marks the beginning of Marvel's Phase 4. The film is slated to release in India on April 30, 2020 -- a day before its release in the US.

Daniel Craig's Last Outing as James Bond

Will ""No Time To Die"" really be Daniel Craig's last outing as James Bond? Will the film introduce a new James Bond? Will there be a female James Bond? Will it present first black Bond? All these questions will be answered with the release of 25th Bond film. Directed by new-age maverick and Emmy-winner Cary Joji Fukunaga, the film will open in April.

Christopher Nolan Returns with Tenet

Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan will return with some mindbending drama in his much-hyped ""Tenet"". Described as an action epic evolving from the world of international espionage, the movie comes with a time travel twist as Robert Pattinson's character and John David Washington's character try to stop an event before the time runs out. Mumbai plays an important role in the spy drama. Also starring actress Dimple Kapadia, the film will release in July.

Disney Plus Comes to India

Disney Plus intensified streaming wars internationally with its launch in November last year. The war will heat up with the platform entering Indian market. The service is expected to arrive in India in the second half of 2020, post the Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament. There will be no separate app as the whole catalog will be available on Hotstar.

Netflix Pumps in Rs 3000 Cr in Indian Content

India will be on the radar of American streaming service Netflix, with plans to invest Rs 3,000 crore on producing exclusive content in India in the immediate future. Star power is going to be one of the most important driving forces for the platform. Bollywood biggies such as Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma are associated with the platform to create content.

Not so much.(CNN) Much has been made of President Donald Trump's strong standing with voters on the religious right, especially after a Christianity Today editorial called for Trump to be impeached and removed from office. The editorial generated a lot of press because Trump won white born-again evangelicals with more than 75% of the vote in 2016 and his approval rating with them remains at 75% in CNN/SSRS polling taken in the middle of last year.

Figures such as these, however, can often obscure as much as they reveal. Trump's standing with all religious voters -- and, in particular, nonwhite religious voters -- is considerably weaker than it is among white evangelicals.

Heading into the 2020 general election, Trump can certainly count on the strong backing of white born-again evangelicals. If he loses, however, it'll be in part because his approval rating is only in the low 40s among those who attend religious services at least once a week and are not white born-again evangelicals.

Even when we concentrate on born-again evangelicals, there are plenty of nonwhite Americans. In fact, nearly 40% of born-again evangelicals nationwide are not white. This includes nearly 20% who are African American. (In a Democratic primary, the majority of born-again evangelicals are nonwhite.)

Simply put, Trump's not popular with nonwhite born-again evangelical voters. His approval rating with them was a mere 29% in an average of April and May CNN polls. Among African American born-again evangelicals, Trump's average approval rating was just 7%. These figures are pretty much unchanged from the percentage of these groups who voted for Trump in 2016, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).

Daniel Malloy is OZY’s U.S. politics editor.

There are a lot of numbers to think about when it comes to this year’s presidential election. But here’s a big one to chew on: 59 percent. That’s the proportion of Americans who are eligible to vote who cast a ballot for president in 2016. The number was up slightly from 2012, and down a bit from a historic high in 2008. But going back decades, the story is roughly the same: 40 percent of the population doesn’t cast a ballot.

In an age where political engagement is through the roof thanks to President Donald Trump, who stokes the strongest of feelings among his supporters and detractors, America is largely dug in. The persuadable middle seems to shrink by the day. That’s why OZY is devoting a large part of our 2020 election coverage to answering the question: Who Cares?

To that end, we partnered with Washington-based data firm 0ptimus to take an unprecedented dive into the last four election cycles to show you — on a county-by-county basis — where voters are turning out and where they are not. We’ve already told you about trends like the Apathy Belt, where voter turnout has sagged, and the county where 100 percent of eligible voters came out to the polls.

In 2020, we will spend the election season telling you about the people and trends behind the mobilization efforts that will determine whether Trump gets a second term.

Campaigning “has been continually shifting away from persuasion and more toward turnout in the overall sense,” says Brian Reisinger, a Republican political strategist in Wisconsin who worked on Sen. Ron Johnson’s 2016 campaign there.

A couple of caveats are necessary. No. 1: Voter turnout does not simply rest on caring or commitment. There are ongoing legal battles across the country over barriers to voting — which can disproportionately affect the poor, students and people of color.

No. 2: Persuasion still matters, and not just for those Obama-Trump voters who have been endlessly dissected for the past three years. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, says the reason many Black voters did not show up for Hillary Clinton in 2016 is not because they weren’t mobilized, but because they weren’t persuaded. “The mistake people will make is they assume that this will be a mobilization base, and they will not have a persuasion plan for them,” Shropshire says. She points to how the Trump campaign is already mounting an effort online and in predominately African American neighborhoods to siphon away some of the Black vote, and she urges Democrats not to wait until after Labor Day to fire up this core constituency.

Part of motivating African Americans to come out and vote blue — as they have historically at around 90 percent — will require a focus on an affirmative vision, not merely an anti-Trump message, Shropshire says. She points to a recent BlackPAC-funded poll of registered African American voters that found big majorities in favor of free public college tuition (76 percent), a wealth tax (71 percent), reparations (71 percent), Medicare for All (65 percent) and the Green New Deal (57 percent) to argue that a Democratic candidate proposing big things will have a better time motivating these voters. In the presidential primary, these issues remain a point of contention. As Bernie Sanders put it in December’s Democratic debate: “You don’t have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you don’t create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America.” He then went on to reference Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college.

Of course, those policies can also serve to motivate Republicans, who will be throwing the word “socialism” around whether Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, is the nominee or not.

But the biggest mobilizer for Republicans right now is impeachment. “Engagement is pretty off the charts,” Reisinger says, with the House voting to impeach Trump and the Senate trial likely to begin this month. Republicans have turned the proceedings into a fundraising bonanza, with Trump seeming to relish talking about it on the stump as he casts the inquiry as illegitimate.

Reisinger acknowledges that Democrats are fired up too, as evidenced by their wins in Wisconsin and nationally in 2018. “We’re used to knife’s-edge elections,” he says, “and we’re used to each side fighting to the end for every last inch.”

Analysts expect that 59 percent to rise this year. The party that best taps into America’s missing 40 percent is the one that will lay claim to the White House come November.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Brian Reisinger worked on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. He worked for Sen. Ron Johnson.
